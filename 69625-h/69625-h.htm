<p class='c016'>Oh! noble Elizabeth! you to
whom these leaves are more particularly
addrest, have you had resolution
sufficient to read thus far? will
you possess sufficient presence of mind
to enable you to continue the perusal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>of this writing, now that I have
placed before you the most important
and most cruel transactions, which have
occurred throughout your whole life,
and by which your whole life has been
embittered? and will you, when at length
you reach the conclusion of my painful
narrative, magnanimously sacrifice your
long-cherished prejudices; and daring
to gaze steadily on the light of truth,
will you learn to excuse and to pity, to
regret and to forgive?</p>

<p class='c017'>Before I relate the transactions, which
followed the fatal interview between
Ida and her lover on your bridal day, I
must request your patient attention,
while I relate those incidents of Henry
of Montfort’s earlier days, which I
believe to be still unknown to
you. It is thus only, that I can enable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>you to form a correct and unbiassed
judgment of the case.</p>

<p class='c017'>Henry’s father stood already on the
brink of the grave, when his son was
born: he died, while Henry was still an
infant. His wife soon followed him.
The care of the little orphan now
devolved upon an uncle, who would have
been much better pleased, if the deceased
Count of Montfort had died without
progeny, and had left him the undivided
inheritance of his fertile and extensive
domains.</p>

<p class='c017'>By his brother’s will this uncle was
appointed guardian to the young orphan,
and destined to be his representative, till
Henry should attain the age of twenty-one.
This limitation of his power was
by no means to Count Egbert’s taste.
He would willingly have disputed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>legitimacy of Henry’s birth; but the
acknowledged virtue of the late Countess
made it impossible to fix any suspicions
upon her character. However,
by dint of solicitations, of powerful protection
at Vienna, and (above all) of
considerable sums of money distributed
among the Emperor’s favourites, he contrived
to get his nephew’s claims set
aside till after his own decease; though
the decree, which thus established Count
Egbert’s succession to the inheritance,
positively excluded any children which
he might have, and regulated, that they
should only succeed to the estates of
Montfort, in case of Henry’s dying without
heirs.</p>

<p class='c017'>Though Count Egbert was already
advanced in years, and was still a bachelor,
nevertheless he was highly offended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>at the restriction thus established against
his lineal descendants, in case it should
ever please Heaven to bestow upon
him such blessings. The sight of the
child became hateful to him; and in
hopes of at once relieving himself from
its presence, and of removing an obstacle
to his contracting a suitable marriage,
he gave his little nephew in charge to
one of his servants, whom he believed
capable of executing any villainy; at
the same time telling him—“To do
with the brat whatever he thought
would be most conducive to his master’s
interests.”—Some little remains of conscience
prevented his declaring his
wishes in more express terms; but what
he said, was quite sufficient to make his
meaning very far from ambiguous.</p>

<p class='c017'>Count Egbert’s servant was a native
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>of Switzerland. He gave his lord to
understand, that he perfectly comprehended
him, and made no difficulty of
taking a solemn oath, that he would
punctually obey his injunctions as exprest
above. After an absence of some
weeks he returned without the child;
his reward was ample; and he immediately
employed it in securing a
kind protection for the orphan Henry,
whom he had neither murdered, nor
abandoned to chance and the wide
world, but had concealed him in a
shepherd’s-cottage near the Lake of the
Four Cantons, in order the more effectually
to secure him against the malice of
his unnatural uncle. The shepherd died,
and bequeathed the child, to the care of
his master, the venerable Melthal.
Count Egbert’s servant (who occasionally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>visited those parts in order to
inquire after the safety of him, whom
he had rescued from destruction) was
greatly rejoiced to find him under the
protection of old Melthal, who was universally
esteemed to be one of the
wisest and best of mortals. He scrupled
not to confide to him the secret of Henry’s
birth, and they arranged together
the means of establishing him in his
rights at a future period. The servant
paid the debt of nature soon after this
discovery, and the mystery of Henry’s
rank and claims remained in the sole
possession of Melthal.</p>

<p class='c017'>He spared no expence in rendering
the boy’s education equal to his future
hopes; and aware, that in all probability
resolution and valour would be the only
means of reinstating him fully in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>possession of his rights, at an early period
of life he sent the orphan away from his
retired and peaceful vallies, and took
measures for his being brought up to a
life of arms.</p>

<p class='c017'>Melthal frequently forsook his cottage
to visit the young Henry, who now
began to give tokens of a real inclination
for his profession, and was more
distinguished in the Emperor’s army,
than any other youth of the same age:
but he never invited Henry to return
his visit among the mountains of Switzerland.
Now, however, that the old
man was sinking under the weight of
years, and began to feel that distant
journeys were more than his debilitated
frame could bear, he determined to send
for the son of his adoption, that he might
declare to him his real origin, and bestow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>a blessing on him, before they should
part for ever. The young man obeyed
the call: his arrival was honoured by a
rural festival; and the young people of
those happy vallies rejoiced in the acquisition
of such a youth, who (as they
supposed) was returned home in order
to pass the remainder of his life among
them, as their friend and fellow citizen.</p>

<p class='c017'>You are already acquainted with the
mutual attachment, to which this festival
gave rise by the meeting of Ida and
Henry under the assumed names of
Rosanna Tell and Erwin Melthal. This
attachment soon became public, and
among others came to the knowledge of
old Melthal. An union with the daughter
of an Helvetian peasant (even though
that peasant was William Tell, and
though the maiden herself was the perfection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>of loveliness and virtue) threatened
the destruction of all those exalted
plans, which the old man had been so
long meditating in favour of his adopted
son; and he thought, nothing more
would be necessary to make Henry
break off this unsuitable connection,
than to discover his noble origin to the
youth, and to exhibit before him his
great expectations in their full splendour.
He soon found, that real love
makes the heart consider all obstacles as
trifles, and believe every thing is possible
except abandoning the object, to
whom its adoration is vowed.</p>

<p class='c017'>Henry of Montfort continued to love
that Rosanna, to whom Erwin Melthal
had sworn eternal fidelity: Ida, Countess
of Werdenberg, (to whom her real
birth was discovered about the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>period) preserved her attachment to the
humble peasant, to whom Rosanna Tell
had pledged her hand and her affections.
Each had been sworn to secrecy;
both concealed the painful mystery
in their respective bosoms; but
neither suffered a day to pass without
repeating the assurance of fidelity beyond
the grave, though both were
secretly conscious, how mighty were the
obstacles which opposed their keeping
that assurance.</p>

<p class='c017'>They were separated. The Emperor’s
commands summoned Henry to the
army; and the old Melthal thought,
that in the present position of things a
slight falsehood would be justified by
the intention, with which it was fabricated.—Accordingly,
a report was soon
circulated, that his grandson Erwin had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>fallen at the siege of Bender. It obtained
universal credit; and Ida, (for
whose sole use the artifice had been
designed) doubted not, that her lover
had perished on the field of glory. <i>One</i>
person however (and that to his great
mortification) was assured of the inaccuracy
of the report. No sooner had
Henry left Helvetia, than Melthal set
out for the Castle of Montfort; he
made known to the astonished Count,
that his nephew was still in existence,
and spared neither persuasions nor
threats to induce the old usurper to reinstate
the true heir in his rights and
titles.</p>

<p class='c017'>Threats and persuasions from the
mouth of a man of sense and probity
came with a force, that few villains
however hardened are able to resist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>entirely. Count Egbert trembled in the
presence of his venerable monitor; and
he presumed not to give him such a
reply, as he would willingly have done,
had he followed his heart’s instigations.
He answered him with fair promises and
professions, the trusting to which cost
the poor old man many a painful journey;
till at length highly exasperated at
having been made so long the dupe of
his soft words and endless delays, he
assumed a tone of such authority, as
almost frightened the trembling usurper
out of his senses, and made him solemnly
swear to lose no time in acknowledging
the claims of his nephew. Unluckily,
this scene agitated Melthal so violently,
that the consequence was an illness,
which soon carried him to his grave.
Count Egbert did not let slip so good an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>opportunity of annihilating the hopes
of Henry; he easily persuaded the unconscious
heirs of old Melthal to give
up to him the papers, which attested his
nephew’s birth, and which, (as they
seemed to relate entirely to the Montfort
family), they made no doubt, were
(as he asserted) his own peculiar property
and no concern of any other
person’s.</p>

<p class='c017'>Now then who was so happy as the
crafty Egbert? in the full exultation of
triumph he was persuaded, that the
papers which he lost no time in committing
to the flames, were the only
proofs of his nephew’s existence. But
in this respect he was deceived. When
Henry departed for the army, Melthal
charged him to seize the first favourable
opportunity of laying his case before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>the emperor; for which purpose he
furnished him with the authentic documents
of his real birth, and those which
fell into Count Egbert’s hands were
nothing more valuable than mere copies.
The favourable opportunity, of which
Melthal had spoken, was not tardy in
arriving. At the siege of Bender Henry
behaved with such distinguished gallantry
as to make it the general opinion,
that if all his companions had performed
their duty as well, the victory would
have been wrested from the hands of
the infidels.</p>

<p class='c017'>The emperor was not the last to applaud
his gallant demeanour. He commanded
him to name a reward; and
Henry demanded to be re-instated in
those rights, to which he could establish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>his claim by proofs, that would set all
doubt at defiance.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“I do not wish,” said he, “that
my uncle’s conduct towards me should
undergo too nice an examination; nor
during his lifetime do I insist, that my
inheritance should be restored to me.
I only demand for the present to be
acknowledged as a descendant of the
house of Montfort, and for the future
to be protected in obtaining those advantages,
to which I may be able to
substantiate a lawful claim.—I am not
desirous of expelling the old Count
from the station, which he has so long
occupied; I only demand, that when
his death shall leave that station vacant,
I may succeed to that, which in justice
is my birth right.”—</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>The Emperor Albert, who was already
aware that under the administrations
of the debauched Venceslaus, and the
careless Sigismund (his immediate predecessors)
much partiality had taken
place in settling the affairs of the Montfort
family, and who besides wished
most anxiously to serve his favourite
in every point that was not repugnant
to justice, heard the above declaration
with pleasure, and praised the youthful
warrior’s generosity. Albert himself
was generous, and it delighted him,
when others acted, as <i>he</i> would have
acted himself.</p>

<p class='c017'>On the next day Henry was declared
by the emperor to be a Count of
Montfort, and was allotted a command
suitable to his high rank and distinguished
services. This change of name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>contributed to support the erroneous
belief, that Erwin Melthal had never been
heard of since the battle of Bender, and
that in all probability he had fallen in the
field. Ida therefore was sorrowing for
his loss at the very moment, that he was
hastening back to the beloved valley,
crowned with laurels, and determined to
share with her his honours and his happiness.</p>

<p class='c017'>Alas! that beloved valley was no
longer to be recognised! dreadful storms
had laid it waste; the mountain-torrents
had deluged the country; and
when he at length with difficulty
had reached Tell’s habitation, he found
it silent and empty—the dreadful pestilence,
which had more than decimated
the unfortunate inhabitants of those
quarters, had raged with peculiar fury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>in the house of Tell; but he was informed,
that a remnant of the family
had taken refuge (so at least it was
rumoured) in the Convent of Engelberg.
Thither Henry repaired without loss of
time, but he found no one capable of
giving him either present comfort or
future hope. His apprehensions were
converted into despair, when in reply
to his enquiries Tell’s humble grave
was pointed out to him, and when he
beheld near it two smaller graves,
which (he was assured) contained the
bodies of two of the old man’s grand-daughters.
It is probable, that this assurance
was given not without foundation,
for several of the grand-children of
Tell had followed him to Engelberg, and
had there fallen a prey to the inveteracy
of the prevalent disease.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>The wretched Henry was thoroughly
convinced, that the bones of Ida and
Constantia rested within those smaller
graves. He knelt beside them; he
watered them with his tears, and abandoned
himself to the most violent emotions
of anguish, which love and despair
ever excited in the heart of man.
It was long, before he attained any
degree of composure; and he employed
the first hour, in which his heart was
sensible of a melancholy resignation, in
hastening to the Convent, and requesting
to know every particular respecting
the death of the lovely sisters. He wished
also to enquire, why they had interred
in the open church-yard the bodies of
those angels, whose virtues should have
obtained for their tomb the most distinguished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>spot to be found within the
Convent’s sanctuary.</p>

<p class='c017'>The high-sounding title of “Count
Henry of Montfort” obtained for him
an easy admission into the Convent-parlour;
but he derived no benefit from
his visit to Engelberg. The old Abbess,
who had superintended the Convent
during Constantia’s residence, had paid
the debt of nature. The present superior
was totally ignorant of the history of
the sisters; and she could not help
secretly suspecting, that the young-warrior’s
understanding was not quite as
sound as it should have been, when
with considerable impetuosity he demanded
as a matter of right, that the
grand-daughters of a common peasant,
who had conferred on the institution
neither wealth nor honour, should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>alloted a tomb in the Chapel of St.
Engeltruda!</p>

<p class='c017'>Henry was at length made to understand,
that Ida’s remains appeared to
be sacred relics in no eyes but those of
her lover: the only comfort, which he
now felt himself capable of enjoying,
was to honour <i>her</i> in death, whom in
life he had adored so truly: accordingly
the greatest part of the wealth, which
he had earned in the Turkish wars, was
expended in raising a stately monument
to Ida’s memory in the Chapel of Engelberg.
He burned with impatience
to see (united with those of the fair
sisters) his own name engraved on the
monument’s white marble, as being
that of the person by whose directions
it was raised; and he declared, that
his heart could never taste repose, till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>the work should be completed, and till
the bones of Mary and Rosanna Tell
(for such he still thought them) were
removed to the honourable burial-place
provided for them by his affection.
While the tomb was erecting, nothing
could persuade him to quit the holy
place even for a day; and the whole
neighbourhood was lost in astonishment
at the homage, which the Count of
Montfort thought it necessary to pay
to the relics of Tell’s daughters.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nothing was able to rouse him from
that dangerous melancholy, to which
he abandoned himself without reserve,
till the emperor’s commands necessitated
his attendance. He arrived at Grans,
and found, that while he had been
giving up everything for the indulgence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>of unavailing sorrow, his exalted protector
had not been equally unmindful of
his favourite’s worldly interests. The old
Count of Montfort had been summoned
to the imperial court; where he was made
so fully aware of the favourable posture
of Henry’s affairs, and was so thoroughly
convinced, that to deny the authenticity
of his claims would be fruitless, that
his nephew no sooner made his appearance,
than he came towards him with
open arms, and embraced him as his
relation and his presumptive heir. He
was then preparing to offer some excuse
for past transactions, which in their
very nature were totally inexcuseable;
but the young Count interrupted his
apologies, freely forgave him, and in
presence of the emperor assured his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>uncle, that he might depend upon his
burying his wrongs in silence and oblivion.</p>

<p class='c017'>Still, when the arrangements respecting
Henry’s succession to the Lordship
of Montfort came under consideration,
Count Egbert earnestly insisted, that
two or three clauses should be introduced,
in order that the future heirs
of his body might not be left entirely
destitute. Henry could not conceal a
smile, while he acceded to this proposal,
and the rest of the company indulged
themselves without scruple in a
loud burst of laughter; for the old man
was still unprovided with either wife
or children, though there was scarcely
to be found in all Germany a lady of
beauty, birth, and fortune, whom he had
not honoured with the offer of his
hand and heart.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>On the other hand, Henry, whose age
would have suited much better with
such proposals, seemed not to bestow
a thought upon the subject: amidst the
throng of lovely women who graced
the court, his heart remained cold as
the marble, which covered the imagined
ashes of his loved and lamented Rosanna.
But the emperor was not equally indifferent,
respecting his young friend’s
contracting some honourable engagement.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Montfort,” said he, “I flatter
myself, that I have omitted no means
of substantiating your claims, which
lay in my imperial power: but fraud
and avarice will frequently suggest such
ingenious expedients for eluding the
execution of justice, that (should I die
before your uncle) you might still find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>it no easy task to obtain possession of
your inheritance. While therefore I
am still in existence and able to serve
you, unite yourself by marriage with
some powerful family, whose connection
may support your claims, when
death shall have deprived you of my
favour and protection.—Your enemies
then will not dare to dispute your rights.
Tell me, Henry; is the indifference,
with which you seem to look on the
beauties of my court, real or affected?—If
your heart has not as yet made its
choice, suffer me to mention to you
the bride of <i>my</i> selection.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>Henry’s reply assured him with great
truth, that there existed not a woman,
who possest any interest in his affections.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Well then!” resumed the emperor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>“take my advice, and offer your
hand to the beautiful Elizabeth of
March, the jewel of all our German
maidens: in her you will find united
youth, charms, spirit, sense, piety, and
virtue; besides a thousand other excellent
qualities, which are seldom to be
met with but in men. Her family too
is sufficiently powerful to secure you
against the attacks of malignity and
violence, to which you will probably be
exposed after my death; an event,
which increasing infirmities make me
believe to be at no great distance.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>Henry had frequently seen and admired
the noble Elizabeth. In truth, it
was considered among the young courtiers
almost as a total want of taste, and
as a proof of a cold insensible heart, to
see Elizabeth and feel nothing warmer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>than admiration. Henry (who could
make no reasonable objection to the
match proposed, and who was unwilling
to confess the fruitless passion, which
devoured his heart, for one who had
long since rested in the grave) could
only assert the improbability of his
obtaining Elizabeth’s hand in preference
to many suitors so much more distinguished
than himself; especially as
it was reported, that her hand was
already destined to the youthful Richard
of Ulmenhorst, her father’s ward and
near relation.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Tell not me,” interrupted the
emperor, “of those reports, and of
your own consciousness of your demerits.
Go to the Castle of March;
become acquainted with Elizabeth’s virtues,
as well as with her charms. I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>certain, that you will love her; I flatter
myself, that <i>she</i> too will love <i>you</i>; and
what pleasure would it give me, dear
Henry, could I see your hands united,
before I close my eyes in this world for
ever!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>An interest so warm, and expressions
so condescending in the mouth of a
sovereign, could not but produce the
desired effect. Montfort obeyed, and
visited the Castle of March. He beheld
Elizabeth; he investigated her character;
she inspired him with esteem, with
admiration ... but not with love.—yet
it was soon evident ... (will the Countess
of Torrenburg ever pardon my assertion?)
that Elizabeth had not seen Henry
with the same indifference. He felt, that
he was preferred; he could not but confess,
that the possession of such an
angel must be an inestimable treasure;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>and though the remembrance of Rosanna
rendered his heart incapable of
any warmer sentiment than friendship,
still since that beloved one was lost to
him for ever, he resolved not to let his
folly throw away the blessing, which
offered itself to his acceptance. He determined
to fulfill the emperor’s injunctions,
and to offer his hand to the
only woman, who was worthy to fill
Ida’s place in his heart. But he hesitated
so long, and took so much time
before he made his declaration, that Elizabeth’s
parents had already promised her
in the most solemn and positive manner
to the rich and powerful Count of
Torrenburg. In consequence, Montfort
was given to understand (though
with every possible mark of esteem)
that his absence from the Castle of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>March would be acceptable to its
owner.</p>

<p class='c017'>Grieved and vexed at his having so
long delayed to explain himself, Henry
departed; the heart of Elizabeth accompanied
him. Count Egbert had never
seemed very anxious for his nephew’s
marriage, nor had given himself any
trouble, in order to forward his views
upon Elizabeth: the fact was, that in
spite of the ill success of his former matrimonial
speculations, he was at that moment
totally engrossed by a new scheme
of the same nature; and the person,
to whom his views were now directed,
was no other than ... the Lady Ida of
Werdenberg. He was not only enchanted
by her personal charms, but he
also took it into his consideration, that
after the Count of Torrenburg’s death
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>she would possess very plausible claims
upon the valuable domains of Carlsheim
and Sargans; claims, which (as the
possibility of his own death was an
idea, which never by any accident was
suffered to enter into his calculations)
this silly old man proposed to enforce
in their fullest extent.</p>

<p class='c017'>He had already given the Count of
Torrenburg some hints of the honour,
which he had it in contemplation to
confer upon his family. The Count in
return gave him to understand, that
if his niece had no objection to the
match, he should not oppose it: and as
the old dotard thought himself irresistible
in spite of former disappointments
(which might have taught him better)
he was on the very point of surprizing
Ida with the agreeable intelligence, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>she had made a conquest of his heart.
It was at this juncture, that the news
reached him of his destined uncle’s
being on the brink of marriage with
the Lady Elizabeth of March.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nothing could be more contrary to
his plans, than this intelligence; Count
Frederick of Torrenburg might have
children, and then there would be an
end of all his claims in right of his
bride, whom he loved not merely as
the beautiful Ida of Werdenberg, but
as the future co-heiress of Carlsheim
and Sargans. Now then he had nothing
more at heart, than to break off this
inconvenient marriage. To accomplish
this, no better means suggested itself,
than to persuade his nephew to a renewal
of his addresses to the intended
bride; and since her hand was no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>longer to be obtained by the ordinary
methods of solicitation, he resolved to
have recourse to a little innocent artifice,
which (he doubted not) would
soon bring the young people to
a proper understanding. Aware, that
Henry was not likely to enforce his
suit with as much eagerness as the
nature of the case required, the uncle
in his zeal for his nephew’s advantage,
or rather for the success of his own
interested views, resolved to examine
himself into the state of Elizabeth’s
inclinations, and to place Henry’s attachment
to her in the most favourable
light. He found the unhappy girl in
tears; the day was already fixed, on
which her hand was to be united with
that of the dreaded Count of Torrenburg.
It was no difficult task to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>her confess her disinclination to her
antient bridegroom, and her preference
for the blooming Montfort, on whom
her heart had long fixed its affections
irrevocably. She also listened without
any <i>very</i> marked signs of repugnance
to the proposal of an elopement. Her
heart and her reason both assured her,
that to avoid the union which she so
much detested, flight was the only resource
left her: her friend Ida had
advised her adopting it without delay;
and now the same proposal was made
to her from a quarter the most unexpected.
Elizabeth was at length persuaded
by the pressing entreaties of
Count Egbert to summon to her aid
the youth, who (as she was assured by
his uncle) burned for her with the
most ardent affection, and to whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>her union with his rival would undoubtedly
give a mortal wound.</p>

<p class='c017'>She wrote to Henry, and declared herself
ready to throw herself upon his protection.
This important step was taken
by Elizabeth through anxiety and affection,
approved of by Ida out of friendship
and ignorance of the world, and
advised by the old hypocrite Count
Egbert for the sake of his own private
interest. As to Henry himself, he was
perfectly ignorant of all that was going
forward, till he received Elizabeth’s
letter: but what man with the feelings
of humanity alive in his bosom would
have disobeyed the voice of an angel
like Elizabeth, pleading for aid, and
confessing her attachment? compassion,
esteem, admiration, and gratitude, all
united to produce a sentiment in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>heart which, if not love, was at least
very like it; a sentiment, which doubtless
would soon have been love itself,
had not unfortunately.... Oh! lady,
you for whom I trace these lines, and
for whose decision (when my task is
done) I shall wait with such anxiety,
this is a chasm, which I leave to be
filled up by <i>you</i>!</p>

<p class='c017'>Elizabeth disappeared—the lovers
were overtaken—the Count of Torrenburg,
when the circumstances were all
made known to him, resigned his pretensions
with a good grace. The entreaties
of Elizabeth’s brother, and some
little apprehension lest her reputation
should suffer injury by this elopement,
induced her parents to withdraw their
opposition to her union with young
Montfort. The marriage-day arrived:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Ida flew to congratulate her friend;
and instead of the enamoured bridegroom
and the happy bride, she beheld
Erwin Melthal stretched pale and senseless
at the feet of the alarmed and astonished
Elizabeth. As Elizabeth saw
Henry’s colour change, she sprang towards
him, and clasped his hand. Hastily
he drew it back with a look of
horror, sank on the ground, and closed
his eyes as if to eternal slumber.</p>

<p class='c017'>She now turned to Ida, who (supported
by her sister) appeared more
dead than living: she demanded the
meaning of this extraordinary scene.
Terror and astonishment sealed up the
lips of Ida; and Constantia also was
silent through doubt, whether an explanation
just then would be adviseable.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“A strange instance of love at first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>sight!” whispered to her next neighbour,
a virgin aunt of Elizabeth’s aged
forty-seven.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“And mutual too, as it seems!”
replied the plump dowager, to whom
this audible whisper had been addrest.</p>

<p class='c017'>Ha! at those words how high swelled
the proud bosom of Elizabeth! How
fiery was the glance like lightning, which
she threw upon Ida, as she turned away!
How contemptuous was the look, with
which she eyed young Montfort, in
whom the care of his servants had just
produced some faint signs of returning
animation. Her impetuous spirit had
always rendered her too susceptible of
sudden and violent passion, and (to
confess the truth) had already betrayed
her into the commission of many a hasty
and ill-judged action. Without waiting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>for further explanation she rushed out
of the chapel, while her eyes flashed fire
as she went. She was followed by all
those, who envied the sisters; and who
were now resolved to devote a day, long
destined to happiness, to the nourishment
of suspicion and resentment; and
who were prepared to use their utmost
arts to render the wounds lately given to
love and friendship incurable.</p>

<p class='c017'>I will not attempt to describe the
state of Ida’s mind. Constantia (who,
though not more able to unravel the
mystery of these unexpected occurrences,
was yet more collected than her
sister) judged it prudent for them to
withdraw as soon as possible from the
curious gaze of the by-standers. Accordingly,
she conducted the bewildered
Ida to her apartment, and then hastened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>to that of the bride, in order that, she
might at once offer explanations and
receive them in return. She had not
yet sufficiently recovered from her first
astonishment to conceive, how strong
an impression to her sister’s prejudice the
scene, which had just taken place, must
have made upon Elizabeth: much less did
she suppose it possible, that her friend
could act so unjustly as to show resentment
against herself for an action, which
(even if wrong) had at any rate been
committed by another.</p>

<p class='c017'>Her surprise therefore was great,
when she was refused admittance to
Elizabeth, with every mark of harshness
and indignation.—She returned sorrowing
from her fruitless embassy; and she
had scarcely regained her own apartment,
before a Chamberlain made his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>appearance there to inform the sisters in
the name of the Lord of the Castle, that
in consequence of Elizabeth’s sudden
indisposition, and of the late confusion
(the cause of which was too well known
to them to make any explanation on
that head necessary) it would be adviseable
for them immediately to quit a
house, in which certainly no bridal ceremony
would be celebrated at present.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the mean while, Henry on opening
his eyes cast his first glances eagerly
towards the spot, where he fancied, that
the spirits of Tell’s grand-daughters had
appeared to him; they were no longer
to be seen. He was now confirmed in
his visionary notions, and implicitly
believed, that he had really seen an
apparition.—He inquired for Elizabeth:
the answer was, that she had quitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>the chapel evidently in displeasure; very
little reflection was necessary to make
him aware, that the singular part which
he had just been playing, made it necessary
for him to hasten to his bride without
delay, and explain the cause of his mysterious
behaviour. While approaching
her chamber, he considered with himself,
whether it would, or would not, be
adviseable to inform her of the vision,
which had just appeared to him, and to
lay open to her the secret history of his
early life! His deliberations, however,
were quite superfluous; for he was
denied admittance to Elizabeth with no
less positiveness and contempt, than had
been shown on Constantia’s application.</p>

<p class='c017'>He felt, that Elizabeth had some reason
to think herself insulted; and instead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>of repaying her scorn with scorn,
he lost no time in justifying himself in
the eyes of his offended mistress.—A
personal interview was denied him; the
explanation therefore could only be
conveyed in writing; but Henry was
not sufficiently an adept in penmanship
to permit his finishing so long an apology
with as much expedition, as the
nature of the case made desirable. He
resolved therefore to employ a secretary;
and as upon inquiry no ready writer
was to be found in the whole Castle
except the family Chaplain (whom I
have already mentioned as the secret
ally of Father Hilarius, and as being
entirely in the Count of Torrenburg’s
interests) he requested his assistance.
He might have chosen from among a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>thousand, and yet could not have confided
his affairs to a more improper
instrument. However, Henry dictated,
and the Friar wrote as follows.</p>

</div>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><i>Henry to Elizabeth.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>You are offended, my beloved!—Nay,
even to myself it scarcely appears
credible, that when I stood with you
before the altar, I should have withdrawn
my hand from yours; that I should
have hesitated to pronounce the words,
which would have made you mine for
ever; that when you looked upon me
with eyes of love, I could have looked
on any other than on <i>you</i>.—No; this
never could have happened by natural
means; the enemies of our love must
have employed infernal arts to delude
my senses and interrupt my happiness!—What
past this evening in the Chapel
must certainly have been produced by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>magic; no otherwise can I account for
it!</p>

<p class='c017'>Elizabeth, my heart was once another’s:
my heart would <i>still</i> have been
another’s, had not death torn her from
me. But my Rosanna has long been
an angel in Heaven; the truth which I
swore to her, and which (while she had
life) I never would have violated, could
not surely extend beyond the precincts
of the grave. Surely that happy-one,
to whom now all things must be known,
must also know, in what degree I once
loved <i>her</i>, and in what degree I now
love Elizabeth: Surely, she cannot envy
you, my beloved, the hand of your poor
Henry; surely, she would not forsake
her own mansions of peace and bliss, to
forbid our union and destroy our hopes
of happiness?</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>And yet, Elizabeth...! Mark,
my beloved, and conceive my astonishment,
my horror!—And yet, Elizabeth,
I swear to you most solemnly, that this
evening as you stood at the altar, I saw
the form of the long-deceased Rosanna
Tell approach, and place the myrtle
wreath upon your forehead; while by
her side stood a second apparition in a
religious habit, the exact resemblance
of Mary, Rosanna’s sister, who is buried
with her in the same tomb!</p>

<p class='c017'>But strange as this circumstance appears,
let it not disturb your tranquillity,
my Elizabeth, nor prevent an union,
on which I depend for all the happiness
of my future life. If the spirit of Rosanna
<i>really</i> appeared, she came not to
destroy the bliss of the man who adored
her, but to give her celestial sanction:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>but for my own part, I am persuaded,
that this appearance was some illusion,
some contrivance of those who envy us,
some magical appearance produced by
monastic arts in the night and secrecy
of the Cloister.—</p>

<p class='c017'>Beloved Elizabeth, admit me to your
presence, and every point shall be explained
most fully. At present I must
break off, for the person (whose pen I
employ to trace these lines) has taken
offence at an expression which accidentally
escaped me, and refuses any longer
to render me his services.</p>

<hr class='c020' />

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>In truth, Henry’s ecclesiastical secretary
was greatly displeased at the words
“monastic arts:” however, an apology
and some pieces of gold not only brought
the avaricious Monk into good-humour
again, but even induced him to offer to
be the bearer of his letter, in case the
young Lord of Montfort should still
think proper to send it, after hearing
what he (the Monk) had to say upon
the subject.</p>

<p class='c017'>Henry gave him permission to speak,
and promised to be attentive.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“You believe then,” began Father
Jacob, “that the form, whose appearance
so greatly surprized you in the
Chapel belonged to a deceased person?—Count
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>of Montfort, it was the living
Rosanna, Tell whom you beheld; Rosanna
who has now exchanged that
name for the more lofty one of Ida of
Werdenberg—You start?—You believe
what I tell you to be impossible?—Nay,
Count, with all my heart! Number
<i>me</i> (if you like it) among those, who
wish to impede you in the gratification
of your new amours: it would be ill-breeding
in me to force upon you the
conviction of a truth, to which you
are evidently so unwilling to give
credit!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>The crafty Friar rose, as if about to
quit the apartment. It is superfluous to
say, that Henry (whose head was now
assailed by astonishment from a new
quarter) did not suffer him to depart.—Father
Jacob possest the whole of Ida’s
history, except in so far as related to her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>adventure with Erwin Melthal: he refused
to communicate any portion of his
knowledge, till this hitherto unsuspected
circumstance had been fully explained to
him. This demand was complied with,
every circumstance was confided to him;
and with astonishing quickness he discerned
in this narrative the means of attaining
an object, which he and his honest
ally, the keeper of Count Frederick’s conscience,
had very nearly at heart, but
which they had found themselves compelled
to abandon in despair.</p>

<p class='c017'>Montfort had finished.—And now
the Monk exerted all his eloquence to
convince his auditor of that, which
Henry’s heart was already most anxious
to believe; namely, that his first oaths
of love ought to be the most binding;
that it was no less necessary to keep his
faith to Ida of Werdenberg than to Rosanna
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Tell; and that his giving that
hand to Elizabeth, which he had sworn
to give to another, would only serve to
form an union unjust, sinful, abominable,
and accursed.</p>

<p class='c017'>Henry was quite of the Monk’s opinion,
long before his oration came to an
end. Of much more consequence did
it now appear to him to renew his vows
to the long-lost late-found Ida, than to
appease the indignation of the offended
Elizabeth. Joy and anxiety almost
bereft him of understanding. The
Monk was commissioned to procure for
him an immediate interview with Ida;
and when Father Jacob returned to him
with the information, that an hour had
already elapsed, since the Damsels of
Werdenberg departed from the Castle,
he forgot (in his impatience to rejoin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>his mistress) so completely all ideas of
propriety, of consideration for the feelings
of his bride, and of the misconstructions
to which he was making his
conduct liable, that without farther
deliberation he sprang upon his courser,
and pursued the way, which the Monk
pointed out to him as that, by which he
might the most speedily overtake the
sisters. In the hurry of his enthusiastic
affection, he forgot every thing else;
he left no apology for the Count of
March; no explanation for Elizabeth;
he even neglected to remind the Monk
to deliver his letter, or to desire him to
clear up the mystery of his conduct.</p>

<p class='c017'>In fact, Father Jacob had other business
upon his hands, than to extenuate
Montfort’s offence in the eyes of Elizabeth.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Immediately on the youth’s
departure, he lost no time in transmitting
the following letter to the family-priest
of Torrenburg.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c006' />
</div>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><i>Father Jacob to Father Hilarius.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Before this letter can reach you,
doubtless the occurrences of this evening
will be already known to you: but
learn from me some circumstances,
which are as yet a secret to all but
myself and the principal actors in them.—Erwin
Melthal, that peasant youth on
whose perfections and on whose attachment
you have heard Ida dwell with
such enthusiasm, proves to be no other
than Henry of Montfort.—Elizabeth is
still ignorant of this previous acquaintance,
and must remain so: with the
sisters she is likely to have no immediate
intercourse, and by my management
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Henry has left the Castle of March in
pursuit of Ida; though to gain time, I
thought it prudent to give him a false
direction, and he is now upon the road
to the half-ruined Fortress, which the
Count of Torrenburg possesses in Thuringia.</p>

<p class='c017'>Let your patron lose no time in hastening
hither—I will take care, that he
shall find the family disposed to consider
his renewed proposals as a most honourable
and fortunate event; and I doubt
not, in the first tumult of her passions,
of disappointed love, violated friendship,
and raging jealousy, Elizabeth may
be easily persuaded to an union, which
will make her mistress of that rival’s
fate, to whose pernicious beauty she
ascribes the loss of her own promised
happiness.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Be assured, it will be greatly both for
your advantage and for mine, that
Elizabeth should become Count Frederick’s
wife. He is advanced in years;
it is highly improbable, that he should
have children; and a rich bequest is
already secured to our convent in the
event of his dying without legitimate
descendants. On the other hand,
should he remain unmarried, there is
every probability of his acknowledging
the Damsels of Werdenberg as
his heiresses; a step, which would ruin
all our hopes for ever, but which (you
may depend upon it) he will never be
suffered to take, if the jealous and incensed
Elizabeth becomes Countess of
Torrenburg.</p>

<p class='c017'>With regard to these hated girls,
whose intrusion is so greatly adverse to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>our interests, no means must be neglected
for expelling them from their
guardian’s house and favour. As to
Constantia, I look upon her as little
dangerous, being (to judge by every
appearance) entirely devoted to a religious
life: it would therefore be
unnecessary to molest her, were not
her fate so closely connected with her
sister’s, that it is impossible to separate
the one from the other. But it is
against Ida that all your skill must be
directed.—Doubtless, Elizabeth’s letters
are still in her possession—Seize them,
either by art or violence, it matters not
which: they must necessarily contain
matter sufficient to convince Count
Frederick, that it was by her advice,
that her friend was persuaded to elope
from him with young Montfort: he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>will look upon her as the traverser of
his views upon Elizabeth, and that will
be sufficient to banish her from his
favour—this will be greatly confirmed
by the appearance of the sisters at Elizabeth’s
wedding, which he cannot but
consider as highly disrespectful to himself
and his feelings; but you must
carefully conceal from him, that Ida confined
in the solitude of Torrenburg
Castle, and Constantia buried in the
silence of her Convent, were both ignorant
of the rejected lover’s name till
after their arrival at the Castle of
March. The Count is noble-minded;
but he is proud, irascible, easily induced
to believe the worst of those who surround
him, and obstinate in retaining
prejudices once received—these are the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>parts of his character, upon which it
must be your care to work, till you
have kindled a flame against Ida in his
bosom, which all her tears will be unable
to extinguish. On the other hand, you
must assail Ida with terrors of her uncle’s
indignation, and with threats of an
immediate union with her superannuated
admirer, Count Egbert: and when you
have terrified her sufficiently to prevent
her conduct from being regulated by
her understanding, assure her, that there
is no way of avoiding Count Frederick’s
wrath and old Montfort’s marriage-bed,
except flight from the Castle of
Torrenburg.—That step once taken, Ida
is ruined; Constantia may easily be
convicted of participation in her sister’s
actions; the ungrateful girls will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>banished from their uncle’s favour irrevocably,
and then the game will be all
our own.—Farewell, and let me hear
from you with all diligence.</p>

<hr class='c020' />

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>The unconscious subject of these
abominable artifices was in the mean
while journeying homewards with a
heavy heart, doubly afflicted by the
injustice of her friend, and the supposed
perfidy of her lover. She had ascertained
no more before her departure
from the Castle of March, than that the
man, whom she had so long believed to
be a peasant’s son, was Count Henry of
Montfort; but it still remained unexplained,
how Henry could have so totally
forgotten his former vows, and have
offered his hand to another. The more
that she reflected, the less reason did
there appear to doubt, that upon discovering
his own noble origin he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>abandoned all thoughts of an union
with the low-born daughter of William
Tell. In the opinion of love this fault
was not to be excused; she in some
degree obtained a forced tranquillity by
resolving, that his conduct had rendered
him totally unworthy of her; and that
even should the inconstant Henry return
to her chains, it would be beneath Ida of
Werdenberg to accept that hand, which
he had insolently withdrawn from the
humble Rosanna Tell.</p>

<p class='c017'>Constantia accompanied her sister for
some part of her journey, but was at
length unwillingly compelled to separate
from her and return to her convent,
attended by the vassals whom the Abbess
of Zurich had sent for her protection.
Ida reached her guardian’s Castle
without meeting any adventure; but a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>mistake of her attendants occasioned
her to go considerably out of her road,
and this delay gave time for Father
Jacob’s letter to precede her at the
Castle of Torrenburg. Father Hilarius
lost no time in searching for Elizabeth’s
letters; he found them, and found them
also such, as he wished. Some, which
would have exculpated Ida, and made
against Elizabeth, he committed to the
flames, and then lost no time in communicating
the rest to his patron.</p>

<p class='c017'>Count Frederick had returned home
on Elizabeth’s bridal day, which he intended
to pass with his niece in silent
melancholy. He had resolved to inquire
into her character with more attention,
than he had done hitherto; and as his
late disappointment had made him give
up all thoughts of marriage for himself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>it was his intention to declare that the
damsels of Werdenberg were his future
heiresses, in case they should prove to
deserve so great a distinction.</p>

<p class='c017'>On his arrival he inquired for Ida;
he was informed, that she was gone to
the wedding of the young Countess
of March.—He started in astonishment,
and father Hilarius shook his head with
a smile. Frederick enquired, how the
girl could have ventured to take a
step, which he could not but look upon
as a marked token of disrespect? or if
she were ignorant of his having payed
his addresses to Elizabeth, why had
not father Hilarius prevented her from
unconsciously offering him this public
affront? the worthy Chaplain shrugged
his shoulders, and answered that—“Good-lack!
he was too old and too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>simple to look after a young wanton
girl with the devil (heaven bless us!)
in her head.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>—“She slipped away,” continued
he, “without saying a word of her intention
to me, or to any one—and as to
her <i>ignorance</i> of your adresses....
Blessed St. Barnabas! she knew much
more about them, than I did myself!—Why,
my lord, I have just discovered,
that she has long kept up a secret
correspondence with the Lady Elizabeth;
and I can bring you the most undeniable
proofs, that you would at this moment
have been happy in the possession of
your bride, had it not been for Ida,
for the self created heiress of Torrenburg;
who instigated her innocent
friend to refuse your hand; who fooled
her into an imaginary passion for young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>Montfort; and when she had entangled
the poor Elizabeth too closely in this
intrigue to admit of her retreating with
honour, who finally persuaded her to
adopt the disgraceful measure of an
elopement.—Yet to say truth, there is
some excuse for Ida’s conduct, since
she could not but heartily wish to prevent
a marriage so extremely detrimental
to her own views and interests.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>Frederick heard every word with
increasing amazement. In a voice of
fury he demanded, that the proofs, of
which the Monk had spoken, should be
instantly produced.—Father Hilarius
then gave Elizabeth’s letters into his
hand, accompanying them with some
reflections on the danger of teaching
women the art of writing; at the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>time reminding the Count, how strenuously
and how frequently he had represented
to him, that in the hands of
so forward a girl as Ida, there could
not possibly be a more dangerous instrument
than a pen; and that to leave
her to the full as ignorant as he found
her, was an object most desirable both
for the Count and for herself.—But his
remonstrances had been disregarded;
Ida was taught to write; and now see
the blessed effects of it!</p>

<p class='c017'>Elizabeth’s hand was not to be mistaken;
and while the Count gazed
upon the writing so well known to him,
the malicious Priest inflamed his resentment
still further by relating various
passages of Ida’s early life, to which
he well knew how to give that colouring,
which suited best with his designs;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>he related, how during the time that
she was believed to be Tell’s grand-daughter,
Ida had greatly shocked her
companions by her free and dissolute
manners; he proceeded to state, that in
consequence her guardians had been
obliged to separate her from Constantia,
lest the one should be perverted by the
bad example of the other; that regret
at finding all his efforts to reclaim her
in vain, had broken the heart of her
adopted father, and sent him with
sorrow to his grave: that she had
carried on an intrigue with a man of
low birth, to whom she was still attached;
and that in all probability it
was her intention to enrich this peasant
with the valuable inheritance, which
she expected to derive from Count
Frederick’s bounty.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>—“And then” continued Father
Hilarius, casting a malicious side-glance
upon Ida’s claims; “and then how
easy will it be for the young fellow to
vamp up some fine story of an unexpected
discovery, and of a relationship
to some illustrious family long concealed,
and thus qualify himself for
assuming openly the proud name of
<i>Count of Torrenburg</i>, in right of his wife,
her generous uncle’s heiress!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>The Count bit his lip: yet after a
long silence he answered, that Ida’s
parentage and claims admitted of no
doubt; and that he wished most heartily,
that she were any other person, in
order that in pronouncing his judgement
upon her conduct, she might have
been entitled to less consideration and
respect.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>—“But in spite of all her faults,” said
he, “I cannot deal harshly with a person,
who is the daughter of my deceased
friend, and of the woman whom I once
adored. Yet on the other hand, such
mean artifices, such acts of interested
baseness, of such flagrant ingratitude,
ought not to escape without due punishment.—Ida
has destroyed the happiness,
which I promised myself in marriage;
it will be no more than a just vengeance,
if I destroy hers in return.—Should
she fail to exculpate herself, she shall
either be immured for life within the
walls of a Cloister, or give her hand
without delay to the old Count of
Montfort, from whom I this morning
received proposals for her hand.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>When he pronounced this sentence,
the Count was standing in an open
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>balcony: as the last words fell from his
lips, he saw Ida with her attendants riding
slowly towards the Castle. He hastily
drew back; and feeling, that he was at
that time too much incensed to give
her cause an impartial hearing, he
ordered Father Hilarius to fill his place—the
Friar exulted at this command:
he knew well the generosity of his
patron’s nature, and dreaded that irresistible
conviction, which ever accompanies
the pleading of injured innocence:
he therefore heard with Great
satisfaction, that the cause was not to
be tried by a judge, the goodness of
whose own heart would naturally incline
him to the side of mercy, justice,
and compassion.</p>

<p class='c017'>Ida had scarcely divested herself of
her bridal robes, when a procession
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>entered her chamber composed of the
chief officers of the Count’s household,
and headed by the reverend Father
Hilarius. The formal manner of their
entrance, and the gravity which reigned
in every countenance, were alone sufficient
to communicate to her mind
some degree of confusion and alarm.—How
greatly were these emotions increased,
when the Chaplain began his
examination, which was preceded by a
terrible description of her guardian’s
anger, and which consisted of questions
so artfully worded, that taken by surprize
and bewildered as she was, she
found herself constrained either to return
no answers at all, or such as were
apparently to her disadvantage.—Sensible
of this at length, she entreated,
that time might be allowed her for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>recollection: the greatest part of her
auditors were well inclined to the poor
suppliant, and felt for her the most
sincere compassion. The Monk therefore
did not dare to act towards her
with all the harshness, to which his
heart prompted him; the further examination
of this affair was postponed
to three hours after sunrise of the next
day, and Ida was left alone.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was midnight.—Ida sat weeping,
while a variety of unpleasant images
crowded before her imagination, and
retraced the many singular and painful
transactions, of which that day had been
a witness. Interesting as had been the
events which took place at the Castle of
March, still her mind was most occupied
by those more recent ones, which surprized
her at her return home.—“Her
guardian Elizabeth’s rejected bridegroom.”—“Herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>accused of having
broken off his marriage.”—“<i>Some</i> offences
laid to her charge, which were totally
incomprehensible.”—“<i>Others</i>, of which
she was conscious, that her unguarded
conduct had made her but too liable
to be suspected.”—“The Count’s
violent resentment.”—“His threats.”—“Expulsion
from the Castle of
Torrenburg.”—“The only choice,
allowed her, the cloister for life,
or an union with the decrepit Count
Egbert.”—Poor, poor Ida! how
wilt thou find a clue to guide thy
bewildered steps aright through such a
labyrinth of dangers!</p>

<p class='c017'>Buried in these melancholy reflections,
she heard not the door unlocked,
by which her apartments communicated
with the public gallery.—At length a
hand gently removed the handkerchief,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>with which she had covered her face.
She looked up, and beheld Father
Hilarius.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Alas! my dear child,” said the
Friar, “what avails your weeping?—believe
me, your affairs are not in so ill a
state, as you may imagine; though I cannot
but confess, that appearances are
greatly against you. Your secret correspondence
with Elizabeth has been intercepted:
I have tried in vain to convince
your guardian, that you were ignorant
of his having any concern in the affair.
Then he looks on your presence at the
marriage, as a personal and designed
affront. It appears indeed from one of
her letters, that your friend herself was
in great doubt, whether you would accept
her invitation. At the very time
of her giving it, she pointed out the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>inconveniences of your coming; she
warned you, that you would incur
your uncle’s anger.... And yet in
defiance of this warning, you went!—As
to the confusion, which your presence
produced at the wedding, of that
we can make out nothing; you either
<i>will</i> not, or <i>can</i> not explain the mystery;
one thing only I can collect from
your account, which is, that you have
made a number of enemies there, who
will spare no pains to injure you, and
to prevent your innocence from being
made clear to the Count.—For that
you <i>are</i> innocent, I have no manner of
doubt; and I will venture to assert,
that in process of time.... But time
indeed, Heaven help us! that is exactly
what is refused you—the punishment
of your supposed offences will be immediate!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>the old Count of Montfort
arrived here not an hour ago; and
your guardian is determined, that to-morrow
shall decide the destiny of
your future life. Of your guilt he is
thoroughly persuaded, and you will be
compelled to-morrow to give your hand
to Count Egbert, if he will condescend
to accept it; or if the old man thinks
that your conduct has now made you
unworthy of such an honour, you will
be immediately confined for life in the
Convent of the Grey Penitents near
Count Frederick’s Thuringian Castle.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>—“And what then must be done?”
cried Ida, wringing her hands in fear
and agony.—“How can I escape so
dreadful a destiny?”—</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Escape?” repeated the Monk.—“Ha!
right! right! my dear child, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>was surely Heaven, that inspired you
with the thought!—Yes! you must
escape; you must fly from the Castle of
Torrenburg!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Escape? fly?”—repeated the
bewildered Ida; “and whither must I
go?”—</p>

<p class='c017'>“To a retreat,” replied the Monk,
“where you may wait in security, till
your uncle’s resentment is appeased,
and your innocence can be made clear
to him.—But you shall know more, as
we go along. I know a secret passage,
by which you may quit the Castle
unobserved. Follow me, for you have
not a moment to lose!—Nay, come,
come! away!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>Thus saying, he caught the lamp
from the table with one hand, and
grasping Ida’s arm with the other, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>drew her from the chamber.—Bewildered,
terrified, she had not presence
of mind sufficient to form a resolution;
and her exhausted frame was unable
to resist the force, with which he urged
her forwards, as she followed him
through the long galleries, rather passively
submitting, than wilfully consenting
to his design.</p>

<p class='c017'>I formerly mentioned, that Count
Frederick still resided on the spot,
which had once been the habitation of
the antient Counts of Carlsheim and
Sargans. To this he had chiefly been
induced by the beauty of the situation:
perhaps too his pride was secretly gratified
by the recollection, that his residence
was the same with that, whence
his ancestors were accustomed to extend
the sceptre of command over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>surrounding provinces, and to set at
defiance the resentment of many a
sovereign prince, who possest much
more lofty-sounding titles but much
less real power and strength.—Still the
gloomy, half-ruined Castle of Sargans
was by no means a mansion suited to
the taste of its modern possessor. Accordingly
he had levelled to the ground
the remains of a wing of this gigantic
pile, which had formerly been destroyed
by fire, and had erected in its place a
stately palace, at once noble in its external
form, and convenient in its interior
accommodations. This was called
the Castle of Torrenburg; while the
forsaken halls and towers of Sargans
were still distinguished by the name of
the “Donat-Fortress,” the two buildings
were separated by courts of considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>extent; the antient one was
in a great measure suffered to go to
ruin, except a few apartments which
were kept up for the accommodation of
domestics, when on solemn occasions
the number of guests was too great to
be received within the walls of the
Count’s own residence.</p>

<p class='c017'>Superstition had not failed to extend
her dominion over the Donat-Fortress.—Traditions
respecting the former
Counts of Carlsheim and Sargans,
which had been handed down from
father to son, and with which you,
Elizabeth, are already well acquainted,
furnished subjects sufficient for a thousand
wonderful stories. In truth, the
prejudice, in favour of the opinion that
the ruins were haunted, was so prevalent,
that not merely among the Count’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>domestics, but even among the inhabitants
of the neighbouring villages numbers
of ghost-seers were to be found,
who had beheld at sundry times (and
with their own eyes) the spirits of
Ethelbert and Urania, of Donat, Helen,
and other traditionary personages, wandering
among those abandoned halls
and moss-grown towers; and they
augured either favourable or inauspicious
events to the reigning possessor,
according as the vision represented a
lady or a Monk, an innocent wife or
her haughty tyrant husband.</p>

<p class='c017'>Ida’s character is naturally extremely
timid, and she had not escaped the
contagion of superstitious terrors. It
was therefore with no slight emotion,
that she found her conductor taking
the way, which led to the ruins.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>—“Whither are you leading me?”
said she frequently, as she followed
him with trembling steps.—“Whither
are you leading me?” she again demanded
almost with a shriek; and as
she snatched her hand from the Friar’s,
her blood froze in her veins at perceiving,
that she had now past the last
of the separating courts, and stood
before the massy walls and lofty round
towers of the Donat-Fortress, whose
colossal portal seemed to stretch wide
its enormous jaws, as if for the purpose
of devouring her.</p>

<p class='c017'>Father Hilarius was now compelled
to stop for a moment, and support his
fainting companion. She reclined her
head against his shoulder; and when
she had in some degree recovered her
spirits, she related to him, that happening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>once to be standing in her balcony
at midnight, she had seen with her own
eyes the apparitions of two Monks
come out of the very gate, before
which they were at that moment standing;
that they went up to the old well
in the corner, whose mouth is overgrown
with moss and weeds, and there
they seemed to vanish; and that upon
relating what she had seen the next
morning, the old portress had related to
her a terrible history of two Monks
belonging to the Abbey of Curwald,
who were starved to death in a subterraneous
dungeon by the order of
one of the tyrant-counts of Carlsheim;
that their bones were buried in that
ruined well, in which Heaven’s retribution
had ordained, that the murderer
himself should perish; and that ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>since that time, the place had been
haunted by the ghosts of the two unfortunate
Friars.</p>

<p class='c017'>Father Hilarius, who frequently made
use of the deserted fortress, when he had
any secret business to transact, could have
easily removed the miraculous part of
the appearances, which Ida had seen;
but it did not suit his plans to quiet
her anxiety by letting her into the
truth. He contented himself with
painting in the strongest colours the
dangers, which awaited her on her
return to the Count’s abode; and with
reminding her, that her only chance of
avoiding those dangers was an instantaneous
flight by means, whose terrors
were merely imaginary.</p>

<p class='c017'>The priest, in spite of all his seeming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>simplicity, was by no means deficient
in eloquence. His descriptions were so
lively, and his arguments came so home
to her feelings, that Ida was soon convinced,
that she could meet with no
ghost more terrible or more hideous
than the old Count of Montfort. She
therefore resolved to follow her guide
without further remonstrance, and only
requested that she might shut her eyes,
and clasp one of his hands with both
of hers in the form of a cross, which
holy sign (she doubted not) would
scare all evil spirits away. To this he
consented, and promised to inform her
when she should be arrived in a place
of safety, and might relieve herself
from this voluntary loss of sight.</p>

<p class='c017'>As they proceeded, the Monk lighted
several torches of yellow wax, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>were fastened at intervals against the
sides of a long passage, opening into a
large hall; he took the same precaution,
as he ascended a lofty marble
staircase; and as soon as he entered a
spacious saloon, he lost no time in
illuminating twelve large chandeliers of
brass, which were suspended from the
roof.—He now desired Ida to open her
eyes, and look round her.</p>

<p class='c017'>He could not have pitched upon a
better method for dissipating Ida’s
fears of ghosts and goblins. Darkness
is the mother of causeless terror; with
the return of light, courage and confidence
return to the trembling heart.
The lamp, with which the Friar was
still busied in lighting the last chandelier,
assured her, that there was nothing
supernatural in the light, by which she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>found herself surrounded; and her
heart expanded with the agreeable impression,
produced upon her by this
sudden and unexpected splendour.</p>

<p class='c017'>She had always pictured to herself
the Donat-Fortress, as the residence of
crows, bats, and screech-owls, a gloomy
chaos of dirt, and dust, and fragments
of moth-eaten furniture. How greatly
then was she surprized to find, that
though everything in truth was faded
and antiquated, yet nothing could be
more magnificent than the saloon,
which she was then examining. It was
hung with tapestry richly wrought and
adorned with pictures, on whose frames
gold and carving had been lavished
most profusely: and through the open
door she looked out upon the illuminated
marble staircase, and down the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>long gallery, whose vista of lights presented
an object at once noble and
agreeable. Father Hilarius advised her
to repose herself for a few minutes, and
conducted her to an elevated seat under
a canopy, which seemed like a throne.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“It was here,” said he “that the
antient lords of the ten jurisdictions were
accustomed to receive the homage of
their vassals, while that anti-chamber
was thronged with their knights and
retainers; and it was from yonder side-chambers,
that crouds of the noblest
dames and damsels of the country
looked out, and admired the magnificence
of the powerful Counts of Carlsheim
and Sargans.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>Ida would not cast a single glance
towards the side-chambers, where the
dames and damsels of former days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>used to assemble, for in these there were
no torches; and she could not help
fearing, lest she should discover in them
some inhabitant of the other world
made visible by the light of his own
burning brimstone. She therefore continued
to look towards the illuminated
gallery, and listened with pleased attention
to Father Hilarius, while he dwelt
upon the brighter parts of the family
traditions, and by descriptions of splendid
feasts and stately tournaments,
contrived to beguile the trembling girl
of her terrors.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“But we forget ourselves,” said
the Monk at length, suddenly breaking
off his narration, “we must not suffer
day-light to surprise us in these untenanted
apartments, where we should
undoubtedly be sought after, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>if found what would be the consequence?
you would be consigned to the arms of
the decrepit Egbert, while I should be
sent back to my Convent with indignation
by your uncle. Come, lady,
come! follow me, where peace and
security await your arrival.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Lead on, good father!” replied
Ida; “be you but my guide, and I
will not hesitate to follow.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Good!” said Hilarius; and then
extinguishing some of the lights, he
took them from the chandeliers.—“Then
take special care of these tapers;
they will be necessary for us on the
way, by which we must escape. Now
then hasten onwards, and be alarmed
at nothing, which you may encounter.
Be assured, there is no real danger.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>Thus saying, he gave her a small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>basket, which already appeared to contain
some provisions, and in which he
now deposited the tapers. These preparations
for a long journey through
gloomy ways were by no means calculated
to preserve in Ida’s mind that
temporary tranquillity, which it had
so lately recovered. An involuntary
shuddering seized her; and as he lighted
her forwards, he assured her so often
of his acting honestly by her, that she
began to suspect, that it must be his
intention to deceive her.</p>

<p class='c017'>They at length reached the most
remote quarter of the Donat-Fortress,
which by no means corresponded with
the magnificence of those apartments, by
which she had approached it. Here nothing
was to be seen but winding staircases,
narrow passages, low roofs, and gloomy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>vaulted dungeons, without end or number,
whose labyrinth bewildered her
memory, and whose aspect appalled
her imagination. Most of them bore
the strongest marks of the ravages of
time: and now they entered an immense
chamber, which according to the Monk’s
account had at one period been the bedroom
of the Countess Urania, and of
many of the ladies, her successors.—A
large vacant alcove still decorated with
the remnants of silken curtains, appeared
to have once been intended to contain
a bed, and confirmed the assertion of
Father Hilarius; an assertion, which
the other ornaments of the room seemed
calculated to contradict. Swords, spears,
and coats of mail were fastened against
the walls, and gave the apartment more
the appearance of a well-furnished armoury,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>than of a lady’s bed chamber.
Ida was on the point of asking the
meaning of such unusual decorations,
when her conductor removed a part of
the worm-eaten tapestry, and opened a
concealed door, through which she
descried a staircase descending to a far
greater depth, than her eye could
reach.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Here is our way,” said Hilarius,
“tremble not, my child, but follow me
without hesitation.—A few hours will
place you in safety.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>Ida shrunk back, and weeping through
extreme terror, inquired, whether this
was the only means of escaping?—The
Friar, who had already found out the
quickest method of removing her apprehensions,
descended part of the staircase,
and as he past, kindled some tapers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>fixed on the balustrade. This experiment
succeeded, as it had done before—Ida
ventured down a few steps, and the
Monk returned to assist her to descend
the remainder; when suddenly springing
past her, he rushed up the staircase,
and passing through the door, closed it
after him with a loud noise.</p>

<p class='c017'>How the blood ran cold in the poor
girl’s veins, when she found herself
forsaken by her guide; how she hastened
after him, in hopes of inducing
him by entreaties to release her from
this unexpected captivity; how she
shuddered at being able to discover no
traces of the concealed door; and how
she at length sank down upon the steps
in agony and despair, when she found
no answer returned to her shrieks for
relief and mercy, all this I need not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>describe to Elizabeth: her own good
and tender heart will make her feel for
the situation of a young creature, by
nature the most fearful of her sex, exposed
to all the horrors of night,
solitude, and silence, at the entrance of
a chain of gloomy caverns, whose existence
till that moment had been unknown
to her, and with whose outlet she was
totally unacquainted.</p>

<p class='c017'>Though she received no answer, she
was certain, that her entreaties for help
were not unheard by the unpitying
Friar. She could plainly distinguish
his footsteps, as he hastened away from
the chamber; and the noise of closing
doors and of bolts shooting back into
their fastenings left her no room to doubt
her being totally abandoned.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Ida was herself unconscious, how much
time elapsed, before she could summon
strength of mind sufficient to reflect,
how it would be most adviseable for
her to conduct herself in this perilous
situation. Undoubtedly, before she
could recover from the shock, a considerable
period must have elapsed; for
when she at length looked around her,
she perceived, that the torches were on
the point of expiring. The dread of
being left in total darkness recalled her
to herself: she sprang from the ground,
and lost no time in kindling one of the
tapers, with which the Monk (who was
far from wishing her destruction) had
providently supplied her basket.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“He does not then desire my
death?” said she, as she saw the flame
rise bright and cheerful, and a kind of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>doubtful joy infused itself into her almost
frozen heart.</p>

<p class='c017'>This persuasion was confirmed, when
faintness compelled her to examine the
contents of her basket. Father Hilarius
(who was no enemy to the pleasures of
the table) had furnished it, as if he had
been catering for himself: the provisions
were the most delicate of their kind,
and a small flask of costly and cordial
wine had not been forgotten. Now
then she began to think, what could
have been his object in conducting her
to this gloomy abode? It was evident,
that he had not left her there to perish
through hunger: was it possible, that
he had meant honestly by her, and that
this was really the best path, which she
could take to quit the Castle? Suddenly,
it struck her, that during their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>midnight wandering the Monk had frequently
mentioned a subterraneous
passage, which conducted to a small
hamlet inhabited in former times by
holy Hermits, and now the abode of
simple villagers scarcely less pure in
manners than their predecessors. He
had described this passage to her with
such minuteness, that she could not
but suppose his account to have contained
instructions for the direction of
her progress; she had at the time paid
but little attention to his remarks, not
conceiving that she was at all interested
in the subject; but she now carefully
mustered up every hint which he had
let fall, and employed her whole strength
of mind in recalling the instructions,
which he had given with such apparent
indifference.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Having at length traced the map of
her road on her imagination sufficiently
to make her hope, that she should be
able to find her way through the gloomy
labyrinth, she ventured to begin her
journey. She carefully avoided various
low-vaulted, passages, which presented
themselves on either side of her, and
which Father Hilarius had already
warned her not to enter; as he said,
that they only led to small dungeons,
in which many victims of the tyrant
Counts of Carlsheim and Sargans had
breathed their last, and which now
formed the unwholesome abode of toads,
snakes, and other loathsome reptiles.
Apprehensive that her light might fail
her, before she could reach the outlet of
these caverns, she fled onwards with all
her speed, and hoped with every moment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>that the next would show her the
magnificent tomb, raised by Count Herman
of Werdenberg in honour of his
wife the lady Emmeline, who had been
long imprisoned in this subterraneous
abode. The sight of this monument
would assure her, that she had not mistaken
the way; and the Monk had told
her, that she would there find three
paths branching out, of which the middle
one would conduct her without a
turning to the cavern’s mouth.</p>

<p class='c017'>But still she hastened on, and still
one taper after the other was consumed,
and still the tomb was not to be descried!
Sleep, and fatigue from the length of the
way, began to operate upon her with
force almost irresistible; yet did she
not dare to close her eyes, lest during
her slumber the taper should burn out,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>and leave her in absolute darkness to
wander through the long chain of dungeons
and passages, till she perished.
In this painful situation her only advantage
was, that her imaginary fears gradually
subsided. Custom and necessity
are frequently the parents of virtue;
and Ida, the timid superstitious Ida, who
so lately could only traverse the chambers
of the Donat-Fortress with eyes
closed, hands crost, and knees trembling,
was now able to tread firmly, as she
hurried along, and feared not to gaze
steadfastly on the surrounding gloom,
with which she was now become
familiar.</p>

<p class='c017'>The poor wanderer could only judge
from the consumption of her tapers,
that she must have journeyed for a considerable
time, and that the mouth of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>the caverns could be at no great distance—this
belief was confirmed, when she
perceived a faint pale light glimmering
through the obscurity of a narrow passage,
which lay before her. The sight
inspired her with renewed vigour. She
hastened towards the gleam: but how
did her spirits fail her, when after proceeding
for some minutes down the
passage she found, that the light proceeded
(not from the day, as she had
fondly hoped) but from a lamp, which
served to illuminate with its blue rays
a place, the sight of which a few days
sooner would have made her swoon
with horror, and upon which even now
she had but too much reason to look
with apprehension and disgust.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was a round vaulted room, whose
sides were hollowed out into niches, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>each of which a coffin was placed; while
here and there the eye rested on a stately
marble monument adorned with carved
work and statues.—Ida shrieked, and
the taper fell from her hand.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Now then,” she exclaimed, “I
am lost indeed! What said the Monk?—Above
all, avoid a narrow passage,
which lies towards the left; it conducts
into the burying-place of a convent.
Should you stray thither, and be discovered
by the Nuns, the object of your
flight will be lost irrecoverably, and
you will only have exchanged one prison
for another. The Abbess is entirely
devoted to your uncle’s interests, and
will not hesitate to restore you to his
power.—Alas! alas!” she continued,
wringing her hands, “how plainly do I
now remember every word of his warning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>though at the time I little thought
of how much consequence it was to my
safety!—Now remembrance comes too
late! I am fallen into the toils: speedy
flight indeed might perhaps yet save me;
but sleep sits too heavy on my eye-lids,
and my wearied limbs are unable to bear
me further.—I must yield to the impulse,
and repose for a few moments, for I am
fatigued almost unto death!—then
should no one discover me during my
slumbers, when I awake, I can re-kindle
my taper at yonder lamp, and shall be
able to pursue my pilgrimage with recruited
strength and courage.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>She then lay down upon the floor near
her extinguished taper, resting her head
against an adjacent tomb; nor was it long
before she sank into a profound sleep.
Little till then did Ida believe it possible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>that she could sleep among graves
and coffins! Still less was she aware,
how near she was at that moment to
safety and protection! Oh! how would
her sorrowing heart have been lightened,
had she known, that a few hours
must necessarily compel one of her best
friends to enter her gloomy resting-place;
one, who at that moment was
grieving at the relation of her flight
from the Castle of Torrenburg, which
had reached him under the most scandalous
mis-representations, and who
was in the most painful uncertainty
respecting her fate and the means of
saving and supporting her. Ida had
unconsciously wandered into the cemetery
belonging to the Abbey of Curwald,
which was under the direction
of her friend and guardian, Abbot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Conrad!—Oh! how eagerly would he
have hastened to embrace and comfort
the poor forlorn-one, could some kind
angel have whispered to him in a dream.—“Ida,
the unfortunate much-injured
Ida slumbers among the mouldering
bones of the Abbots of Cloister-Curwald!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>Conrad had dispatched messengers
on all sides in pursuit of Ida, as soon as
he received the news of her flight,
which Count Frederick transmitted to
him without delay. It seems, that what
Father Hilarius dreaded with so much
reason, had actually taken place at the
Castle of Torrenburg. No sooner was
the first burst of passion over, than the
Count’s justice made him resolve to
give his accused niece a personal hearing—the
morning had scarcely dawned,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>when he sought her apartments. Her
favourite attendant was ordered to
apprize her mistress of his approach:
great was his astonishment, when the
maid returned extremely agitated, and
informed him, that Ida was no where
to be found. Father Hilarius was immediately
sent for; and his explanation
of Ida’s motives for flight of course
was such, as served greatly to increase
his patron’s indignation, and throw a
still deeper shade upon the character
and conduct of the fugitive. Elizabeth’s
bridegroom had disappeared, immediately
after rejecting her hand at the
altar; Ida was now become equally
invisible: it required no great ingenuity
to connect these two events together.
Nothing could appear more probable,
than that Ida had eloped with Henry,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>and that she was gone to form an union
built upon the ruined happiness of her
best friends, and to exult at having
duped those, whose good-natured simplicity
had prevented them from suspecting
her designs.—Count Frederick’s
generous heart was shocked beyond
expression, when he thus saw the
offences of his niece presented before
him in such gigantic enormity.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Monstrous!” he exclaimed! “inconceivable!
first she plunges a dagger in
the breast of her benefactor, by robbing
him of the woman whom he adored;
next she stabs her dearest friend to the
heart by seducing away the bridegroom,
into whose arms she had herself
delivered her! now then she believes,
that her infernal work is complete; she
knows well, that all ideas of an union
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>between me and Elizabeth are prevented
for ever; she doubts not, that vexation
and disappointed love will soon conduct
me to the grave; and then she means
to divide my rich inheritance with the
partner of her iniquities, the false
capricious perjured Montfort!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>Father Hilarius now stepped forward,
and represented to him, that it only
depended upon himself to ruin the
plans of those, who had so grossly
offended him; and that as to his union
with Elizabeth, he for his part saw no
impossibility in the case. The Count
eagerly desired him to explain his
meaning; and the obedient Monk proceeded
to prove with the whole force
of his eloquence, that Elizabeth deserved
pity rather than blame for her share
in these transactions; that she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>been seduced from her duty more by
Ida’s arts than by her own inclinations;
and he declared his perfect conviction,
that if the Count would now condescend
to make the first advance towards a
reconciliation, he would find her as
full of penitence for her error, as grateful
for his proffered affection, and as
eager to unite with him in a plan of
mutual revenge, as even the Count
himself could desire.—Nor did he make
this last assertion rashly. Father Jacob
had already apprized him, that every
thing at the Castle of March was favourable
to their views; and he advised
Hilarius to send his patron thither
without loss of time, in order that
Elizabeth’s resentment (upon which he
chiefly grounded his hopes of success)
might not be allowed time to cool.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Count Frederick took the Friar’s
advice, which was greatly strengthened
by a supposed vision of the Patron-Saint
of Torrenburg, who had condescended
in a dream that very night to
assure Father Hilarius, that the consequence
of a visit to the Castle of March
would be an union with the lovely
Elizabeth. Accordingly the Count lost
no time in setting out to renew his
once-rejected proposals, habited as a
bridegroom, and attended by a princely
retinue. In the mean while the worthy
house-chaplain did not even allow himself
time enough to say his paternoster,
before he dispatched letters to the
Bishop of Coira and Abbot Conrad, in
which he related the flight of their
ward, the Lady Ida of Werdenberg, in
all its circumstances; stating also the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>alledged motives and supposed consequences
of this step, and above all not
forgetting to place every circumstance
in the light most unfavourable to
the Heroine of the Tale. As they perused
these letters, the Abbot and the good
Bishop alternately felt indignation at
Ida’s errors, pity for her misfortunes,
and anxiety for the dangers in which
she had involved herself. Willingly
would they have believed her innocent;
but appearances were too strong against
her, and the Abbot little imagined, that
the only person capable of removing
the suspicions, which he was so anxious
to efface, at that very moment reposed
so near him.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the mean while Ida awoke greatly
refreshed by a sound sleep of several
hours. She re-kindled her taper, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>resumed her anxious journey; yet she
delayed it for a few moments, while
she endeavoured to read the inscriptions
on the monuments, and ascertain to
what order the Abbess belonged, whom
Hilarius had described to her in such
odious and terrific colours. These
clearly exprest, that the tombs were
raised in honour of the former Abbots
of Cloister-Curwald, in whose cemetery
she was standing at that moment: what
blessed information for her agitated
heart!—the door was unguarded.—A
marble staircase conducted to the
interior of the Abbey!—But alas! the
inscriptions were composed in the Latin
language.—Ida vainly endeavoured to
comprehend the meaning; and a few
moments sufficing to convince her, that
her endeavours must be vain, the poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>wanderer turned away from the neighbourhood
of her friend, and hastened
to meet her ruin.</p>

<p class='c017'>With trembling limbs and an heart almost
bursting with anxiety, she pursued
her gloomy path. She continued to
proceed for a considerable time; and
her last taper was almost expiring, when
its beams fell upon the object, which
she had wished to behold so long and
so anxiously. She was now certain of
having followed the right path, for she
saw at a distance the monument of her
progenitrix, the noble Emmeline of
Sargans.</p>

<p class='c017'>The polished and shining surface of
the white marble reflected from afar
the gleam of Ida’s taper—the pilgrim
hastened towards it with eager joy,
not untempered by religious awe and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>reverential terror. With scarce-heard
foot-fall, as if she dreaded to disturb the
dead silence of a place thus sanctified,
did Ida ascend the steps leading to this
memorial, raised in honour of faithful
love and long suffering. It was some
minutes, before she could resolve on
venturing near enough to examine
the statues, with which it was adorned.
On one side stood a female angel (the
counterpart of the lovely Emmeline)
who trod under her feet the symbols
of cruelty and voluptuousness, and who
extended to a kneeling warrior her
right hand, on whose wrist was still
fastened part of the chain, which <i>he</i>
had broken.—On the opposite side appeared
the same warrior, who with looks
of gratitude held a ring towards Heaven,
probably in allusion to the prophetic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>dream, which had guided Herman of
Werdenberg to the deliverance of his
mistress.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Spirits of my ancestors!” exclaimed
Ida, as overpowered by her
sensations she sank on the loftiest step,
and kist the hallowed marble; “spirits
of Herman and Emmeline, hear the
prayer of your forsaken persecuted
daughter! <i>I</i> suffer now, as <i>you</i> once
suffered;—<i>I</i> am innocent, as <i>you</i> were
then!—save me, ye blessed-ones! save
the heiress of your sorrows!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>Ida prayed long and fervently.—When
she arose, she found that her
last taper was exhausted, and had left
her in total darkness; this however
gave her little concern. The religious
duties, in which she had just been
engaged, had inspired her heart with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>enthusiastic courage: besides, she knew
well, that of the three ways branching
out of the circular vault in which she
was at that moment, she had only to
chuse the middle one, which (as Father
Hilarius had informed her) would conduct
her straight to the outlet of the
subterraneous passages. She ascertained
easily by examining the walls, which of
the three was the proper path to take,
and then hastened boldly forwards;
for she was now persuaded, that the
invisible spirits of her ancestors hovered
over her, and she dreaded no danger,
while protected by those celestial guardians.</p>

<p class='c017'>The Monk had told her true—the
way was straight and unembarrassed
with windings: it soon began to ascend,
and the delighted wanderer could at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>length discover the faint glimmering of
day-light, through the distant opening.
But alas! however near may be the
goal of our wishes, who shall dare to
count himself secure of reaching it!—Ida
had for some minutes heard a dead
hollow noise behind her, and the ill-boding
sounds had already occasioned
her sufficient anxiety to make her double
her speed. Still the noise became more
audible: and now she could plainly
distinguish the steps of men, whose
arms clattered, as they past along. She
looked back, and could perceive the
glimmering of faint lights at a distance.
She rushed forwards with increased
rapidity: the sounds, which became
every moment louder, convinced her,
not only that she was pursued, but that
her pursuers gained upon her.—Fortunately,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>the opening was now at hand;
she summoned up all her strength and
activity to reach it, sprang through it,
and found herself once more restored
to air and light.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Praised be Heaven, I am safe!”
she exclaimed: when at that moment
she felt a cold hand seize her by the
arm.—She shrieked, and fell on the
earth senseless.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was long, before her recollection
returned. When she again unclosed
her eyes, she found herself no longer
in the open air. She was placed upon
a kind of couch, in what she supposed
to be a tent; a group of men of terrible
and savage aspect surrounded her; and
seated on a chest at no great distance,
she perceived a warrior in complete
armour, whose raised visor showed a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>countenance wild, ’tis true, but still
noble and commanding.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“At length then we have found
her!” said the warrior in a tone of
exultation—“the lovely pilgrim is in
our power, whom we so long sought
in vain through yon gloomy vaults and
subterraneous passages.—You are welcome,
fair lady: Father Hilarius gave
us notice, that we might expect your
visit; and I rejoice to find, that the
description which he gave us of your
charms, was far from exaggerated.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Have mercy on my distress, Sir
Knight!” cried Ida, who now rose
from her seat with difficulty, and sank
at his feet, while she extended her fettered
hands in supplication towards him.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Father Hilarius assured me,” she
continued, “that I should find the habitation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>of some holy Hermits near the
cavern’s mouth: oh! if any such habitation
really exists, in pity guide me
thither!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Compose yourself, lovely girl,”
answered the stranger.—“Hilarius has
not deceived you, neither has he deceived
<i>us</i>.—He promised us the possession
of a treasure, and he has kept his
word, though we mean to make a
better use of it than that, for which he
consigned it over to us. He promised
you, that you should find here the
habitation of certain Hermits; and he
told you true, for you are actually in
a Hermitage at this moment: many
years ago was this the retreat of some
fugitive Monks, who were obliged to
seclude themselves from the intercourse
of mankind; and it still forms an abode
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>for a band of daring and persecuted
spirits, whom tyranny and injustice
have banished from the world. We
too are Hermits, though not quite such
holy ones as those, whom you excepted
to meet. But what does that
signify? saints, or sinners, I warrant,
you will fare better in our society, than
you would with any company of Monks,
that ever concealed hypocrisy under
sackcloth.—Take this as a specimen of
the whole canting-tribe. Father Hilarius
has commissioned us to remove
you so far from this province, that your
face may never be seen here again:
we have engaged to convey you to a
place, where beauty like yours is always
a marketable commodity, and sure of
fetching a heavy price: but you are
too fair, too good, too noble, to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>sacrificed to the embraces of an infidel:
no, child! we mean to do better for
you. You shall remain with <i>us</i>, and
your priestly enemy shall be foiled in
his treacherous designs.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>—“First understand,” interrupted
Ida, whose indignation in spite of grief
and terror burst forth upon hearing
this insolent declaration of the outlaw;
“first understand, to <i>whom</i> you speak!
I am no ordinary captive, no low-born
girl the fit associate for a band of robbers!—you
see in me the niece of
Count Frederick of Torrenburg!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Indeed?” replied the outlaw,—“are
you then <i>really</i> Count Frederick’s
niece?—why, to let you into the whole
secret, we were told as much, though
we did not give the Monk full credit,
and suspected <i>that</i> part of his story to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>be an invention for the purpose of
obtaining a better price.—But since
you are in truth the person whom he
mentioned, so much the better; your
rank and expectations make your possession
doubly valuable. I have no sort
of objection to exchange my precarious
mode of life for security and opulence,
nor by laying aside the title of captain
of a band of outlaws to claim that of
Count of Torrenburg in right of my
wife, its lovely heiress. With the assistance
of my companions I will reinstate
you in your rights; the previous
possession of your hand and person
will entitle me to share your good
fortune; and I shall be indebted to you
for my restoration to my proper rank
in society, which necessity has for some
time past compelled me unwillingly to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>resign. Now then you are apprized of
my whole plan, which suggested itself
as soon as Hilarius informed us of your
rank, and in which I am fully confirmed
by the powerful impression produced
upon my heart by your beauty.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>He paused: Ida only answered with
her tears—after a few minutes past in
expectation of her reply, the robber
thus resumed his discourse.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“You are silent? you weep?—Ha!
perhaps you are offended that your
hands are fettered?—be comforted;
those white hands shall instantly be restored
to liberty!—instantly undo those
bonds, barbarians that you are! how
could it come into your heads, that it
was necessary to bind a poor defenceless
girl, whose escape is so impossible?—shame
upon your flinty hearts, how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>could you bear to treat so inhumanly
such innocence and such charms!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>The other robbers now hurried to
remove the fetters; but their captain
drove them away with curses, and
declared, that from that moment no
one except himself should dare to approach
his lovely captive on pain of
instantaneous death.—He then kissed
the unbound hands of Ida, led her
respectfully into another tent, and there
left her alone, after entreating her to
compose her agitated spirits, and assuring
her, that she might rely upon
meeting from him with none but the
most honourable treatment.</p>

<p class='c017'>Ida, equally overcome with mental
and bodily fatigue, sank into a state of
unconsciousness and stupor, which the
sentinels who were appointed to guard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>the entrance of her tent (and who
from time to time looked in upon their
charge) interpreted to be a tranquil
sleep, and failed not to bring this
welcome intelligence to their captain.—He
received it with the highest satisfaction,
hailed this refreshing slumber
as the first step towards the restoration
of tranquillity, doubted not that he
should find Ida more composed and
resigned to her fate on his evening
visit, and found her almost frantic
through despair.</p>

<p class='c017'>The peremptory manner in which
Ida rejected his addresses, and the little
progress which he made in reconciling
her to her present situation, grieved
the robber-chief to the very heart, but
did not excite his indignation. He
continued to treat her with the utmost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>respect and attention. Nothing was
denied her except liberty; and Randolf
(for that was the name of the enamoured
outlaw) carried his politeness and
deference so far, that he never even
presumed to enter her tent without
having previously obtained her permission.</p>

<p class='c017'>Ida, whose presence of mind gradually
returned, and who became collected
enough to reflect on the best means of
conducting herself in such difficult circumstances,
could not but feel, that
such attention on the part of Randolf
required some return on hers. She
was totally in his power; it was unwise
to exasperate him; and she therefore
judged it prudent to allow him permission
to pay her a daily visit of an hour,
since she feared with reason, that without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>this voluntary concession he might
be induced to allow himself greater
liberties without asking her leave.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“May I, lady,” said he one
morning, after she had past some days
in his power; “may I request permission
to present to you one of my
friends, who holds in this society the
next place to myself?—he is a nobleman,
whom misfortunes have compelled
like me to adopt a mode of life, which
we both look upon with abhorrence,
and which with the first opportunity
we are determined to exchange for one
more honourable.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>Ida was sufficiently aware, that the
<i>opportunity</i> to which he alluded, was
the possession of her hand, by which
he hoped to give himself a claim to
the Count of Torrenburg’s rich inheritance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>He frequently in conversation
threw out hints of this nature, but
which she judged it most wise to let
pass without observation. She now
only answered that part of his speech,
which regarded the introduction of his
friend, and to which (as she feared to
irritate her jailor by a refusal) she gave
an unwilling consent.</p>

<p class='c017'>On his next visit he was accompanied
by a man, whose countenance
was much more wild and his manners
much less prepossessing, than those of
Randolf. The latter presented the new
visitor by the name of Sir Gero of
Altheim.</p>

<p class='c017'>The captive soon understood from
the conversation, which past between
the associates, that the antipathy, which
Gero’s first appearance had excited in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>her bosom, had not been excited without
good grounds. He possest not the
smallest share of that delicacy and
respectful attention, by which her lover
was characterized. He permitted himself
to make the most licentious and
offensive observations upon the extraordinary
charms of her person, and
raised her original disgust to abhorrence
by blaming Randolf for having suffered
his passion to remain so long ungratified;
assuring him at the same time,
that he would have dealt far differently
with his own lovely mistress, had not
her religious habit terrified him from
using force, and thereby drawing down
the vengeance of offended Heaven.—For
it seems, this wretch, though he
trampled upon all laws human and
divine, was still a slave to the grossest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>superstition, and trembled at the very
sight of a veil or a rosary.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“She has now been some days in
your possession,” observed Randolf;
“have you made any progress with the
fair Nun?”—</p>

<p class='c017'>“Not I!” replied Gero; “she is a
miracle of beauty, its true, but her
obstinacy equals her charms. Since the
day that I captured her on the road to
Zurich, I have been able to obtain
nothing from her but tears and entreaties
for her liberty: and as to proceeding
to violence, I am too much afraid of
the resentment of holy mother church,
or I should put an end to her resistance
before to-morrow morning.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>During this conversation Ida remained
silent, and abandoned herself to the
melancholy reflections excited by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>increased consciousness of the execrable
society, of which she was so unfortunately
become a member. But now
when she found that she had a companion
in misfortune, and that a person
of her own sex (a virtuous and persecuted
Nun) was so near her, a sentiment
of secret satisfaction and hope
infused itself into her bosom.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Oh! Sir Knight,” she exclaimed,
addressing herself to Randolf, “how
happy would you make me, could you but
procure for me the company of Sir Gero’s
captive! it is disgraceful, it is dreadful,
for a young maiden to be alone in a
society entirely composed of men and
strangers; and I feel, that the presence
of a person of my own sex would be
to me a source of the greatest consolation!
it would conduce beyond all else
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>to make me endure my confinement
with resignation! oh! good Sir Randolf,
plead for me with your friend, and
persuade him to allow me this unexpected
pleasure!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>The smile, with which she accompanied
this request (’twas the first
which played upon her lips, since she
became a captive) was irresistible. As
she pronounced the last word, she extended
her hand towards him, and he
kissed it with rapture. A wish, exprest
in a manner so fascinating and so
unlooked for, was a law to the enamoured
robber; and addressing himself immediately
to his companion, he enforced
her request with so much energy,
that Gero though with a sorry grace
found himself compelled to grant it.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Now then” said Randolf, as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>left the tent with Gero, “now then
you can judge for yourself, which of
our modes of treating our captives is
the most likely to succeed at the long
run. When did your Nun ever speak
to you with such gentleness, or favour
you with so sweet a smile? when did
she ever extend her hand towards you
of her own accord, and suffer you
to press your lips upon it? credit me,
Gero; send her to my mistress, and I
will bet my head upon it, that before
long half her obstinacy and aversion
will have disappeared. You see, how
complaisant I have made the lady Ida;
and it only requires a little kindness
and flattery well applied to make our
religious ladies, just as tame and as
obliging as their sisters of the wicked
world.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>In the course of the day Randolf
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>returned to inform Ida, that she must
not expect the visit of the captive Nun
till after midnight.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“My friend,” said he, “is obliged
to keep it a profound secret from the
greatest part of our companions, that
such a prisoner is in his possession.
That he has a mistress, indeed, they are
aware; but it would make a terrible
uproar in our community, were it
known that Gero had carried off a Nun;
and many among our associates, who
would think nothing of half a dozen
murders, would expect the rocks to
fall and crush us the very next moment,
for daring to lay sacrilegious hands
upon a damsel dedicated to Heaven.
To be sure, we violated no sanctuary
to get at her, for we found her trotting
along the high road, when she ought to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>have been quiet within the walls of her
Convent: but still the very sight of
a veil has such influence over the
common rabble, that Gero does not
think it prudent to bring her to your
tent except under the protecting shadow
of night. He also implores you by me
to reward him for this compliance with
your wishes, by persuading her to lend
a more favourable ear to his passion:
he is also desirous of learning her name,
which hitherto she has obstinately concealed;
and above all he is anxious,
that she should lay aside her religious
habit, which hourly exposes him to
danger from his superstitious associates.
I know, what you are going to observe:
you believe, that it is nothing but respect
for this habit, which preserves her
from Gero’s violence; but I swear to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>you by everything that is most sacred
and solemn, that neither she nor yourself
have anything to fear from the
men who adore you. Our intentions
towards you are the most honourable:
we have great designs in hand, whose
nature I am not as yet permitted to
disclose to you; but be assured, that
should they succeed, the Countess of
Werdenberg and the fair Nun will have
reason to bless the day when they fell
into our hands, and thus escaped the
being immured for life within the
gloomy walls of a Convent; a fate,
from which <i>she</i> has been rescued, and
to which <i>you</i> were doomed.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>The prudent Ida, (who saw that
favours, which had cost her so little,
were so well rewarded by her grateful
admirer) took good care not to contradict
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>the robber. She answered him
by a thousand thanks for his intercession
with Gero, and for his assurances of
regard for her welfare; and she then
dismissed him with a smile so gracious
and so sweet, as riveted his chains for
ever. When beauty, and sense are
united in the same woman, alas! what
puppets in her hands are the mighty
lords of the creation!</p>

<p class='c017'>Midnight arrived—the hearts of both
the captives throbbed with impatience
for the moment of meeting, though
they knew not, what made them so
impatient. Never seemed time to move
so slowly with Ida, as while she waited
for the stranger’s arrival; and on her
side the lovely Nun quite trembled
with joy, while she followed her conductors
to the tent, in which (so Gero
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>had informed her,) she should find a
companion in captivity, whose heart
was prepared to sympathize in her
misfortunes—the robbers conducted her
to the door of the tent; but thinking
it would be most agreeable to the ladies,
that their first interview should pass
without intruders, they suffered her to
enter alone.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was well for both the captives,
that this meeting took place without
witnesses.—Ida was sitting in a melancholy
posture, when she heard an approaching
footstep.—She started up,
and beheld by the pale gleams of her
lamp a tall light figure, whose face was
covered with a thick veil, advancing
from the entrance of the tent. She
hastened to meet her, but uttering a
loud cry, she started back again. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>religious habit worn by the stranger
was but too well known to her.—It
was the long grey garment decorated
with a golden cross upon the breast, in
which she had so often seen the Nuns
gliding through the cloisters of Engelberg;
and the white veil, edged with
black and falling to the very ground,
was of that particular form appropriated
to the order of the Zurich Sisters. The
veil was now hastily thrown back; Ida
gazed eagerly upon the Stranger’s features,
and astonishment, joy, and tenderness
were carried to the highest
pitch.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Constantia!” exclaimed Ida.—“Oh!
Heaven! it is my Constantia!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Ida! my Ida!” shrieked the Nun,
and clasped her almost fainting sister
to her bosom.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>And now the Sisters wept for joy to
think, that they were once more
united; and now they wept for grief
at reflecting, that this union had only
made each a partner in the other’s captivity.
At length having sufficiently
collected their scattered thoughts, they
made mutual enquiries as to the events,
which had produced a meeting so unexpected.
Ida related the long and
fearful tale of adventures, which had so
rapidly crouded upon her since Elizabeth’s
wedding: on the other hand,
Constantia briefly stated, that on her
way back to her Convent at Zurich, her
party had been encountered by a band
of robbers: the Cloister-Vassals, whom
the Abbess had sent to protect her,
were soon put to flight; and thus was
she brought into the hands of Gero,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>whom she had the misfortune to inspire
with so violent a passion, that he purchased
her from his companions with
his share of the booty arising from the
whole produce of their excursion.</p>

<p class='c017'>The night past away in mutual congratulations
on this meeting so unexpected;
and when morning broke, they
recollected, that their plans for the
future were still unarranged. They
had now only time to settle, that as
the knowledge of Ida’s rank had only
served to make the robbers consider
her possession as of double value, it
would be most prudent to conceal
Constantia’s real title; and accordingly
she resolved to resume her former appellation
of Mary Tell, an appellation under
which she had past the only happy
part of her existence.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>When Randolf the next morning
inquired of Ida, what she thought of the
fair Nun, she replied, that her society
was extremely pleasing, and would be
much more so, were it not for a certain
coldness and reserve, which probably
would wear off upon further acquaintance.
In a few days she informed Gero,
that she had discovered the name of his
mistress to be Mary Tell; and thus did
Constantia avoid the dangerous importance
attached to the title of a Countess
of Werdenberg. By her sister’s advice,
she abated somewhat of the haughty
coldness, with which she had hitherto
represt the addresses of her ferocious
lover; though they both judged it
unwise for her to comply with his
request, that she should lay aside her
religious habit.  This had hitherto been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>the means of protecting her against
more violent means of enforcing his
passion; and they were of opinion, that
too many restraints could not well be imposed
upon an affection so ill-regulated
as the sentiment, which Gero dignified
with the name of love. However, gentle
looks and expressions of gratitude
for his attentions were not occasionally
refused by Constantia: Gero had
been so little accustomed to be thus
mildly treated by her, that even
these trifling condescensions appeared
to him of inestimable value; and when
in return for his assurances of future
respect, she one day deigned to extend
towards him her alabaster hand, the robber
was so transported, that he took the
first opportunity of thanking Ida upon
his knees for a change, which he attributed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>entirely to her powerful influence,
and which he implored her to exert still
further in his behalf.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Noble lady,” said he, “you have
often heard Randolf hint, that we have
great plans in agitation, whose chief
object is the promotion of your interests;
nor are they unconnected with the happiness
of myself and my adorable Nun.
A dreadful oath forbids my saying
more on this subject at present; but rest
assured, when the time for explanation
arrives, that explanation will be such, as
must perforce content you. In the
mean while suffer me to make to you
one request. It is necessary for the
success of our undertaking, that yourself
and the lovely Mary (together with our
jewels, gold, and all things which we
possess of value) should be removed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>from this valley to a retreat at some
distance.  During the journey, and
your residence at this new abode, promise
me, that you will keep a watchful
eye over your fair companion, on whose
attachment I can by no means rely with
the same confidence, which Randolf
places on yours.  In this respect, he is
far more fortunate than his friend;
since the kind reception, which he never
fails to meet from you, in spite of
the awe with which your modest air
and dignified demeanour inspires him,
leaves but little doubt, that you are sensible
of his worth, and will in time
be disposed to reward so steady an
attachment.  Besides this, I am convinced,
that you have too much solid
understanding to think of escaping from
a place, whose very nature will convince
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>you on your arrival, that any such
attempt must be unsuccessful: but no
one can say, what dangerous impossibilities
a Nun may not be induced to undertake,
animated by religious enthusiasm,
and confident in the supposed
protection of the Saint, to whom her
service is dedicated. These illusions
may heat her brain, till she desperately
braves every peril, overlooks every difficulty,
and will draw down inevitable
ruin on her own existence, while she
leaves me to lament over my baffled
hopes. Then mark me, Lady!—watch
over Mary’s steps with unceasing assiduity:
when we again meet, restore her
to me safe and lovely, as I now leave
her; or never hope to see yourself re-instated
in your claims by the valour
of my arms and those of my companions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>nor restored to society by the
acknowledged title of Countess of Werdenberg,
and heiress of the wide domains
of Torrenburg, Carlsheim, and Sargans.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>This speech, which was begun in a
kneeling posture and in the softest tone,
which a voice so naturally rough could
adopt, assumed as it proceeded an air of
menace, and was terminated by Gero
with a terrible frown and a loud stroke
upon the brazen pommel of his sword.
Nearly the same discourse was repeated
to her in the evening, (though conveyed
in much milder language) by Randolf.
She delivered such a reply, as circumstances
compelled her to give, and trembled,
as she listened to some obscure
hints and disjointed observations, which
fell from the outlaw, but which no solicitations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>could induce him to explain.
However, she had heard enough to
excite in her mind the most painful
apprehensions, though not enough to
certify their being well-grounded.</p>

<p class='c017'>The preparations for setting out were
soon completed: the treasures were
packed up; and the Sisters were now
informed, that the place of their destination
was a narrow valley situated in
the heart of the Mountains of Hapsburg.
Gero and Randolf took a tender but
respectful leave of the fair travellers,
who were escorted by a small band of
soldiers, composed of such members of
this lawless society as were unfitted by
advanced years for taking part in that
great undertaking, to assist in which,
the young and active were detained.
The ladies set forward, but not till Ida
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>had made some observations, which
rendered her doubly impatient to commence
her journey.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Oh! my sister,” she said, as
soon as she found an opportunity of
conversing without being overheard,
“did you not observe among Randolf’s
followers countenances, which you
had seen before? In spite of their
change of dress, I am certain, that the
two who rode next to Gero were Friars,
who often visited the Castle of Torrenburg.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Alas!” answered Constantia, “it
is not now, that I learn for the first time,
that a perfect understanding subsists
between these robbers and the unworthy
members of some religious community.
During my confinement in Gero’s
tent I frequently observed monks among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>his visitors; of whose principles you
will judge, when I inform you, that they
made no scruple to counsel my encouraging
the licentious addresses of my
jailor, though they were thoroughly persuaded,
that I was a dedicated Nun:
they offered to release me from my
vows, laughed at (what they termed)
the absurdity of my prejudices, promised
me entire absolution, and advised
me to pay no more respect to my veil,
than they did to their cowls and scapularies.
Conceive, dear Ida, my sufferings,
while compelled to listen to such profane
suggestions, and to repress the indignation,
which they excited in my
bosom.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>—“And have you then no guess,”
demanded Ida, “what is the object of
an union so singular?—Did they never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>let fall a syllable, whence you could
collect the nature of this mysterious
enterprize, on which they are now
departed?”—</p>

<p class='c017'>Constantia declared her perfect ignorance
on the subject.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Alas! alas!” resumed Ida,
“dreadful apprehensions force themselves
upon my mind! Randolf frequently
suffered hints to escape him,
which the more that I reflect on them,
serve but to confirm my fears the more.
The robbers have a private understanding
with the false Hilarius.—The Monks,
whom I discovered in Randolf’s train,
are of the same order with that betrayer!—It’s
true, Count Frederick has treated
me cruelly and unjustly, and now little
merits, that I should feel anxiety on his
account. Yet, oh! that I were but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>near him for one half hour, that I might
warn him of the dangers, which hang
over him and his, and which I would
willingly avert, though the price were
the last drop of my blood and the last
breath existence.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>The Sisters had full leisure in the wild
solitude to which they were conveyed,
to communicate to each other their
mutual fears and melancholy forebodings.
Ida’s insinuating manners soon
rendered her a favourite with her grey-headed
guards; and the persuasion of
Constantia’s religious vocation made
them bow with superstitious reverence
at her approach, and hold it an honour
to be suffered to kiss the hem of her
sanctified garment.  In consequence of
these prepossessions in their favour, the
Sisters had no other reason to complain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>of their treatment in confinement, than
the confinement itself.</p>

<p class='c017'>The place, in which they now resided,
was inaccessible to all, except the robbers,
and the rays of the sun. It was a flat
spot surrounded by a chain of snow-covered
mountains; one narrow footpath
hewn in the rock was the only
entrance, whose windings were known
to none except the ferocious inhabitants
of this valley; and which the sudden
descent of weights of snow and of ice-splinters<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c021'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
from the over-hanging rocks
frequently rendered for some time impracticable
even for them. The Sisters
shuddered, as they gazed upon the gigantic
masses of rocks of ice, which glittered
coldly around them as far as the eye
could reach; and they could not conceal
their terrors at reflecting, that a single
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>motion of those cloud-covered summits
would be sufficient to convert the valley
into their inevitable grave. The chief
of their guards, however, upon hearing
them make this remark assured them,
that this never <i>would</i> happen, because it
never <i>had</i> happened yet.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c022'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Avalanches.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c017'>—“You must know, fair ladies,”
said he, “that I am one of the most
antient among the heroes, who have the
honour to serve under the banners of
Sir Randolf of Mansfeld. While I was
but a child, I fled hither with my poor
father, then the innocent victim of
monkish persecution, and we found a
kind refuge in the bosom of these
mountains. The man, who was then
at the head of this hospitable community,
had been acquainted with the first
institutor of the band, and had learned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>from him many remarkable particulars
respecting this valley; some of them in
good truth enough to curdle the young
blood in your veins with very terror:
but as to such an accident as that which
you apprehend, never had such a thing
been known to happen. Therefore set
your hearts at rest, ladies: the valley
lasted out <i>his</i> time; you see, it has
almost lasted out <i>mine</i>, and I warrant
you, it will last out yours also.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>The Sisters had no better means of
passing the tedious hours of captivity
than in listening to the old robber’s
never-ending narratives: besides, they
thought it by no means impossible, that
in the warmth of discourse some particulars
might escape him, which might
tend to the improvement of their own
situation. They therefore often entreated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>him to relate the adventures of
his father, who had been so unjustly
persecuted; as also to tell them, what
he had learnt, from his first captain,
respecting the original founder of this
society of freebooters, and to give them
some account of the various singularities
of the mountains. They could not be
better pleased to listen, than the old
man was to talk; and he answered these
inquiries at much greater length, than I
shall repeat at present: with his persecuted
father we have no occasion for
concerning ourselves; and as to the
wonders of the mountains, we are likely
to obtain a more particular description
of them from another quarter: the only
point then, which need be repeated for
the gratification of the curious, is the
manner, in which the habitation of holy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Anchorets became converted into a retreat
for banditti.</p>

<p class='c017'>Whoever is acquainted with the
antient history of Sargans, cannot but
remember, that these private recesses of
the mountains were inhabited by a
society of fugitive Monks from Cloister
Curwald. The institution of this society
took place in the time of Count
Ethelbert of Carlsheim; and it was
continued by the occasional reception of
new members, as often as death reduced
the number, to which it had been
limited by its founder, Abbot Christian.
That number was six; but for want of
novices it was reduced to two, at the
period, when Luprian, the licentious
Abbot of Cloister-Curwald, (flying from
the vengeance of Count Herman of
Werdenberg, and from the punishment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>due to his inhuman treatment of the
Lady Emmeline) was conducted by
chance to this secluded Hermitage.</p>

<p class='c017'>The pious Anchorets received him
with the most benevolent welcome:
they gave full credit to his tale of persecuted
innocence, and looked upon the
virtuous sufferer as an angel conducted
thither by the hand of Heaven, that he
might comfort and sustain them under
the infirmities of age, and might close
their eyes, when death should draw
nigh their stony couches. This last
piece of service Luprian lost no time in
rendering them. He imagined, that
they possest concealed treasures of immense
value, which would enable him
to lead once more a life of luxury in
some foreign country, could he but
obtain the inheritance of his hosts. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>consequence of this persuasion, the old
hermits slept in the grave sooner, than
nature had intended; and Luprian
without an hour’s delay ransacked every
corner of the cave. His expectations
were cruelly disappointed.  He found
nothing more than the usual possessions
of an Anchoret; cowls, scapularies,
crosses, and a few relics of saints
and martyrs.  But of gold or jewels
there appeared not the slightest vestige;
and Luprian had the mortification to
find, that he had committed one of the
most horrible crimes ever perpetrated
on earth, without deriving from it even
the most insignificant advantage.</p>

<p class='c017'>Yet was it not its guilt, which made
him lament the commission of this
action; no, ’twas its having been committed
without reward.  His conscience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>was by no means of so delicate a
texture, as to make him feel uncomfortable,
while inhabiting the scene of this
atrocious murder. On the contrary,
he resolved on making this well-concealed
retreat the theatre of fresh
offences, and immediately employed
himself in collecting a set of men,
whose hearts were depraved, whose
characters were blasted, and whose prospects
in the world were ruined like his
own. These he conducted to the
mountain-valley, and became the founder
of a band of free-booters, which had
now existed above a hundred years,
and which had brought inexpressible
calamity on all the neighbouring country.
The rich and the poor, the nobleman
and the peasant, alike mourned
over their ravaged fields, and plundered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>dwellings, their murdered children and
dishonoured wives; and yet did the
authors of all this mischief set punishment
at defiance, protected by their
secret caverns and their snow-clad impracticable
rocks.</p>

<p class='c017'>Their numbers had gradually increased.
Hither fled for refuge many a ruined
nobleman, no longer able by honest
means to supply his pampered appetites
with those indulgencies, which habit
had now made absolutely necessary:
many a fugitive Monk, who dreaded
the chastisement so justly due to his
violated vows: many a blood-guilty
culprit, to whom the world offered no
happier prospect than the gibbet or the
rack: and alas! many an innocent sufferer,
driven by the persecution of the
powerful or by the bann of the church to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>this wild society, in whose polluted
bosom he for the first time became
acquainted with guilt. The numbers
of these banditti now considerably exceeded
a thousand, all of whom acknowledged
as their chiefs Randolf and
Gero.</p>

<p class='c017'>Besides the above information, the
old robber communicated to his fair
questioner many particulars respecting
the neighbouring mountains, every succeeding
one of which was more wonderful
and terrific than its predecessor.
The Sisters believed no more of these
extraordinary tales than they thought
proper: however, they obtained much
more credit with the one, than with
the other. Ida’s solitary wanderings
through the subterraneous caverns of
her uncle’s castle had given her a degree
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>of confidence in danger, which before
was totally wanting in her character:
and the experience which she had thus
acquired, in addition to her natural high
spirits and enthusiastic imagination, converted
her from being the most timid
of created beings into a kind of demi-heroine,
ready for adventures, and disposed
to set all perils at defiance.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“All things well considered,”
said she to her sister, as they sat one
star-light night before the door of their
cavern, round which their guards lay
sleeping; “all things well considered,
I am convinced, that flight is absolutely
necessary, and by no means unlikely to
be attended with success. Whether
Randolf and Gero prosper in their plans,
or fail, their return will equally bring
with it our certain ruin. Then before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>that dreaded return takes place, let us
summon up our resolution, and seize
the first favourable opportunity to explore
the way through yonder chain of
mountains, which old Hugo has described
to us in such terrible colours.
The way, by which I fled from the
Castle of Sargans, was not without its
horrors: yet I soon grew accustomed
to them; and how far inferior were
they to those, which I had heard attributed
to the caverns, and which I believed
to be real, till experience convinced
me of my error! Oh, be assured,
Constantia! we shall find, that a similar
deception has been used in the present
case. Yonder mountains, I am persuaded,
are not entirely covered with
ice and snow; between them may be
found, no doubt, many a green and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>sheltered valley, where we may rest
occasionally, and recover strength sufficient
to endure and to conquer the
dangers and difficulties of the way, which
still remains to be traversed. Who knows,
but their lofty heads conceal from us
some happy smiling regions, where we
may pass the rest of our lives unknown
and unnoticed in innocence and peace,
and may become once more as happy,
as we were in the morning of our
youth on the banks of the Lake of
Thun and in the green vallies of Frutiger?—Dearest
Constantia, be resolute,
and let us hazard the attempt! For the
worse, our situation cannot change:
we can lose nothing, even should we
fail; we may gain every thing, if we
succeed: even at the worst, the attempt
however unprosperous must obtain for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>us <i>one</i> advantage, a release from captivity
by death without dishonour.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>In answer to these representations,
Constantia reminded her sister of the
fearful traditions, which Hugo had
related to them, respecting the mountains,
and the fantastic beings supposed
to inhabit them. She pointed to the
Halsberg Rock, whose steep and lofty
head rose exactly opposite to them,
glittering through the gloom of night
like an immense star; and she inquired
of Ida, to what cause she attributed this
extraordinary splendour? Was it by
any means improbable (she asked) that
these inaccessible heights were appropriated
to the residence of evil spirits;
who by night endured there the
punishment due to their crimes in sulphureous
fires, of which that light was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>the reflection; and who by day employed
themselves in leading astray such
unwary travellers, as ventured too near
the place of their mysterious torments,
and in hurling them down frightful
precipices into depths and abysses, never
to rise again?</p>

<p class='c017'>Ida replied, that it was by no means
her intention to travel into the clouds
so far as the place, whose dazzling
brightness had induced her sister to
people it with such terrific inhabitants:
and she added, that being determined
on flight, she was better pleased to
believe, that the brightness itself, which
seemed like a crown of diamonds encircling
the brows of the venerable Halsberg
and his brethren, proceeded merely
from the reflection of the moon and
stars on the ice-covered cliffs and crags,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>than from brimstone and sulphur burning
in a terrestrial Hell.</p>

<p class='c017'>Constantia’s long abode in a convent
and her visionary turn of mind, made
it difficult for Ida to get the better of these
superstitious terrors: yet at length she
succeeded. They began to make the
necessary preparations for their attempt.
They lost no opportunity of secreting
such provisions, as were not of a very
perishable nature and were easy of conveyance;
they also endeavoured to
accustom themselves to taking but little
sustenance in the course of the day; and
they soon flattered themselves, that
whatever might otherwise be the dangers
of their expedition, they were at
least secure against suffering from the
attacks of those two most cruel enemies
of poor pilgrims, hunger and thirst.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>As to pretences for absenting themselves
from the valley, they were easily to be
found. The robbers were too thoroughly
persuaded, that flight was
impossible, and too strongly imprest
with the idea, that women were too
great cowards to hazard such an attempt,
for them to keep any very strict watch
over their prisoners.</p>

<p class='c017'>Constantia was particularly dexterous
in laying springes for snipes, woodcocks,
and other birds, which frequented
these rocks in great numbers; and the
light-footed Ida would often explore
places in search of their eggs, where the
chamois himself would scarcely have
ventured to climb. Then when the
Sisters were successful, they knew so
well how to prepare their booty for the
table in a manner the best calculated to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>please the palate, that even old Hugo
did not think it beneath him to accept
a part of the savoury repast. Sometimes,
the eagerness of this pursuit prevented
the girls from perceiving the flight of
time; and night was already closing in,
before they regained the cavern. However,
as they seldom returned with
empty hands, and as they always did
return at last, these long excursions
were seldom found fault with.—One
of the robbers indeed thought proper
in a moment of ill-humour to remonstrate
with Hugo on the too great
liberty allowed the captives, and to
represent the possibility of their seizing
the opportunity to escape; but the
old man was faithful also on this occasion
to the opinion, which he had
formerly given respecting the fall of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>the ice-crags; and continued to content
himself with thinking,—“that which
never had happened, in all probability
never would happen at all;” indeed
this was on all occasions a favourite
maxim with him: and he frequently
averred, that his adhering to it through
life had saved his head many an unnecessary
care, and his limbs many an
unnecessary journey.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the course of these excursions, the
Sisters had examined the lower part of
most of the mountains towards the
north. They agreed, that a particular
path, which seemed to lead straight
over the Halsberg Rock, appeared to
offer the most convenient passage and
the greatest prospect of a successful
end to their journey. By this path
then they determined to set forward,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>as soon as they could summon up resolution
sufficient to enter upon so dangerous
an undertaking; but this was
no easy matter, and they still thought it
better with every succeeding day to
postpone their journey to the next.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the mean while, it appeared that
Gero and Randolf had not found their
plans so easy of execution, as they had
flattered themselves would have been
the case. This was evident from their
thinking it necessary to send for the
greatest part of those of their associates,
who had been appointed to watch over
the captives and treasures concealed in
the secret valley; and who, being chiefly
men, whose strength was considerably
impaired by age or wounds, could only
be required to give assistance in some
case of most urgent necessity. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>unexpected demand for their services
produced much disturbance among the
grey-headed miscreants. The Sisters
thought this a favourable opportunity
for putting their design in execution.
Their preparations were already completed:
each took a basket well-filled
with wine and provisions in her left
hand, and grasped with her right a
strong and knotted staff to support her
tottering feet, as she traversed the slippery
paths of the mountains: and then
with hearts beating anxiously, and with
cheeks, almost as pale as the snow-hills
to which their steps were addrest, they
set forward to pursue a path till then
never trodden by the foot of mortal.</p>

<p class='c017'>Each was persuaded, that she was
thoroughly acquainted with the nature
of these mountains, because they had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>examined the two or three first miles
of them. They dreamed of green vales
and silvery fountains, because they had
occasionally found such among the
lower parts of the Halsberg Rock.
But how bitter were their sensations,
when they perceived, that with every
moment the path became more rough
and difficult; when they found, that
their endeavours to keep on the same
level were in vain, and that they were
compelled to ascend into the more bleak
and lofty regions of the mountain! at
length they stopped in despair: they
exchanged looks of terror, and murmured
a few broken words, respecting
the hopelessness of their attempt and
the necessity of returning. They embraced
each other with a sigh of anguish,
and then began to retrace their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>way to the robber’s valley; for even
this now appeared to them an object
less terrible, than certain death in this
kingdom of frost and desolation. However,
they had not proceeded far, before
they discovered, that (miserable as it
was) even this last resource was denied
to them. It was evident, that they had
missed their way; to which ever side
their course was directed, they still
found themselves compelled to ascend.
It seemed, as if they were inclosed in
some magician’s circle, from whence
there was no escaping; or as if incensed
at their invasion of his territories, the
spirit of the mountain had so fascinated
their eyes, that they could only see the
paths which led upwards to his cloudy
palace, but none which by descending
into the vale would enable them to
escape from his vengeance.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>As yet they had not felt themselves
quite solitary in these realms of terror.
Sometimes a chamois bounded by them;
sometimes their footsteps, echoing from
the frozen rock, scared from its nest a
screaming eagle: but still the further
that they advanced, the more silent and
awful seemed all around them; and the
greater that the number became of those
gigantic masses of ice, which they left
behind, the greater number still were
seen towering before them in the distance.
Here all animation seemed to
end: here the stillness of death appeared
to have fixed its everlasting dwelling.
No solitary weed, no single blade of
grass showed itself from between the
frozen rifts. Only here and there
appeared some scanty patches of moss,
and of another plant without colour,
taste, or smell; thin, frail and white as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>the snow, from which it was produced.</p>

<p class='c017'>Constantia paused for a moment:
she prest her sister’s hand, and silent
tears streamed down her cheeks, while
she pointed to a pair of milk-white
butterflies; the only living creatures
to be seen in this melancholy place, and
perhaps the last, which <i>they</i> should ever
see. It was clear, that not their own
sport or inclination had brought the
insects thither, but that some unlucky
gust of wind had forced them into
these inhospitable desarts. The poor
little flutterers flew round each other
for a while in still contracting-circles,
and then sank on the ground, overpowered
by the killing wind which blew
from the Ice-hills. The Sisters gazed
upon them with looks of compassionate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>anguish; in the fate of these two unfortunate
wanderers they read their
own. Their feet were already seized
by the frost; it would have been impossible
for them to have proceeded
much further, had not a better path
presented itself before them. This, it is
true, was free from ice and snow; but
on the other hand it was much more
difficult and rough, on account of immense
masses of fallen rock, which
occasionally barred up the path completely.
Over these they were obliged
to climb, not without danger; neither
did they suffer themselves to be scared
from proceeding by the precipices,
which frequently yawned on both sides
of them, and threatened the poor
Pilgrims with death in their abysses.
But oh! how amply were they repaid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>for all which they had suffered in
traversing this path, when they perceived
some narrow planks laid from one of
those precipices to another. Here then
were certain proofs, that human beings
had past this way before them; had
performed the journey with success;
and had left these memorials to assure
any wanderers who might follow them,
that it was not impossible for patience
and perseverance to overcome the
obstacles, which opposed their painful
progress. Now then the Sisters hastened
onwards with fresh spirits and recruited
hopes. Alas! it was not long, before
each separately perceived skulls, and
other fragments of human skeletons,
which told them but too plainly, how vain
was the attempt of escaping from these
rocks with life! each knew but too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>well the object which shocked her;
each felt but too plainly the truth, which
the sight of that object conveyed: but
neither told what she had seen to the
other, lest she should make her sister’s
bosom share the anguish of her
own.</p>

<p class='c017'>Thus did the poor weary girls continue
to wander onwards, till day-light
faded; the increasing gloom made the
surrounding objects appear doubly terrific.
At length the moon rose. Ida
and Constantia were passionate admirers
of the charms of nature: it is true,
that their hearts were too full of anxiety,
and their limbs too much tortured by
the severity of the frost, to admit of
their feeling in its whole strength of
beauty the admirable scene, which the
moon-beams now exhibited to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>view: yet was not that beauty entirely
disregarded by them. Each called her
sister’s attention to the dazzling and
indescribable splendour, which now unexpectedly
surrounded them: each, in
hopes of imparting a gleam of momentary
satisfaction to the other, exaggerated
her admiration at the pompous
show, and forced an expression of
pleasure into her countenance, which
was totally foreign to her heart. The
moon rose still higher; her image was
reflected a thousand-fold from the
enormous crystallizations, which presented
themselves on all sides, hanging
from the broken crags, and threatening
every moment to fall into the profound
gulphs beneath them. The objects
around seemed on a sudden like some
region described in romance, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>diamond-rocks and palaces of precious
stones are raised in an instant in a wild
desart by the wand of some arch-magician:
everything appeared enchanted,
and the Sisters, as they now hastened
onwards, seemed wandering in a flood
of silver light: but alas! that light was
cheerless and unwarming. It only enabled
them to contemplate the regions
of frost around them, but gave them
no relief from the pain, which that
frost inflicted! with a sentiment of
sorrow not to be exprest, they folded
each other in a strict embrace.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“All around us is so bright and
fair!” said Ida; “alas! and <i>we</i> are so
wretched!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>Constantia only answered her with tears—yet
after remaining for a few moments
in this attitude of tender sorrow, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>were sensible, that a kind of cheering
warmth had communicated itself from
each bosom to the other. Yet Constantia
now declared, that she found it
impossible for her to proceed onwards:
but if any place could be found, not so
totally frozen as to threaten any one,
who should rest there, with the sleep
of death, she trusted, that after a short
repose she should be able to resume her
journey with recruited strength and
spirits. They had fancied for some
time, that they could distinguish the
distant murmur of a stream of water;
and they now naturally concluded, that
a place, where water was still unfettered
enough to flow, could not be altogether
destitute of warmth.</p>

<p class='c017'>Ida encouraged her fainting sister to
drag herself a few paces further, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>hopes of discovering that place of rest,
which she had just declared so necessary.</p>

<p class='c017'>They ventured to enter one of the
enormous caverns, which the penetrating
moon-beams deprived of some part
of its natural terrors. As they proceeded,
they were sensible of a different
temperature of air from that, which
they breathed in the more exposed
parts of the mountain: by comparison
they could almost call the sensation,
which they now experienced, by the
pleasing name of warmth; and the feel
of something like soft moss under their
feet encouraged them with the conviction,
that here at least all vegetation
was not completely at an end. The
roar of the water-fall by this time was
almost deafening; but no persuasions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>could induce the timid Constantia to
advance one step further into the
cavern, than where it was illuminated
by the moon-beams.</p>

<p class='c017'>She sank almost insensible upon the
mossy carpet; while the more active
Ida bethought herself of every possible
means of alleviating the sufferings of
her fellow-Pilgrim. The contents of
their baskets remained untouched, for
anxiety of heart had prevented them
hitherto from being sensible either of
thirst, or hunger. Ida now bathed her
sister’s pale lips with some drops of
wine; she then splintered the staves,
which had guided their tottering steps
in this hazardous journey; and she
hastened to collect a few precious fragments
of broken wood, which while
entering the cavern she had remarked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>in the moon-shine; probably they were
the remains of a plank, which had served
some former traveller as a bridge over
the wide chasms between the rocks.</p>

<p class='c017'>With a flint and the steel clasp of
her girdle she contrived to strike out a
few sparks of fire. It was not long,
before she had the satisfaction to see
the wood blazing; and she started in
admiration and astonishment at the
magnificent show, which the strengthening
fire-light presented before her; the
Sisters were at the entrance of an immense
and vaulted cavern, whose sides
and roof appeared to be entirely formed
of ice: from the extreme end of it the
rush of the water-fall proceeded and
was repeated by innumerable echoes:
while the flames played sometimes on
large sheets of crystal, smooth, bright,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>and polished as Venetian mirrors, and
sometimes fell upon the broken crags
of the rock, whence they were reflected
in a thousand ways, and which they
tinged with a thousand colours.</p>

<p class='c017'>But this was not the time for amusing
herself with unprofitable observation,
and Ida soon recovered herself
from her momentary enthusiasm. Constantia
lay by the side of the little fire,
still in great need of comfort and assistance;
and it was long, before her
sister’s efforts to revive her produced
the desired effect. The first favourable
consequence of these endeavours was
a gentle slumber, as she lay reclined
upon the moss, which by this time,
had acquired a slight degree of warmth;
Ida seated herself close by the fire,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>occupied in feeding and preserving it,
and determined not to allow her eyes
to close, in order that she might
devote herself to watching the slumbers
of her sister.</p>

<p class='c017'>Yet the night appeared so long, that
she would have found it impossible to
resist her inclination to sleep, if she had
not sought some more active employment.
Accustomed by her adventures
in the Donat-Fortress to long wanderings
in caves and darkness, she resolved
to beguile the tedious hours with exploring
the more retired depths of the
rock, and tracing to its source the
water, whose distinct roar assured her,
that it could be at no great distance.
The kindly warmth of the fire had
recruited her spirits and restored her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>strength in a great measure; and she
found herself able to undertake the
task of wandering through the frozen
cavern, without being in danger of
yielding to the cold. Midnight was
past, when guiding her course by the
light of a blazing fire-brand she drew
near the thunders of the cataract,
and her limbs trembled less with cold,
than with expectation of the sight
which she was now on the point of
witnessing. Who can penetrate without
emotion into the earth’s interior
sanctuary? who can presume to pry
into Nature’s secret abodes, where the
great Mother brings forth those children
of her strength the mighty Floods, without
feeling awe-struck by the bold and
desperate undertaking?</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>The blazing fire-brand was here unnecessary.
An opening in the cavern’s
roof gave free admittance to the moon-beams,
and the whole extent was brilliantly
illuminated. Ida now beheld a
spectacle, to which she doubted whether
the whole universe could produce a rival.
From the summit of a rock of ice, whose
height the eye measured with difficulty,
and which was entirely formed of the
river’s own frozen evaporations, did
the rapid torrent of the Aar precipitate
the whole volume of its waters headlong,
till it reached an enormous mass of
broken pieces of rock, the probable accumulation
of ages. Here it divided
itself into more than twenty lesser
rivers, which sought their passage into
the vale below, in a variety of directions.—The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>scene was most splendid, but also
was most awful!—the moon-light made
the foaming flood appear like a torrent
of liquid silver; which produced the
most singular and fantastic effects, as it
rushed with rebellowing roar among
the groupes of colossal rocks around
it, and interrupted with the glitter of
its streams, the deep gloom occasioned
by their shadows, Ida looked up to
the awful height, whence the torrent
descended, covering her with the light
sprinkling of its foam: she looked down
into the fearful gulph, in which its
waters were buried: she looked upon
the cavern’s glittering walls, covered
with incrustations of innumerable shapes
and colours, and upon the moving
shadows, which fell from the surrounding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>gigantic rocks. The sight was too
much for her; she felt her head grow
giddy; the fire-brand dropt from her
grasp, and she sank upon the ground
almost insensible.</p>

<p class='c017'>She soon recovered herself, and
hastened to quit a scene, whose awful
beauties were more than she could bear
in the weak and agitated state of her
nerves. She could discern the glimmerings
of the distant fire, and hastened
back to the outward cavern; where
she found Constantia still buried in
repose. The flame was now getting
low, and more fuel was not to be procured:
but it had already warmed the
cave sufficiently to remove any apprehension,
lest the sleeper should be frozen.
Since therefore her watching ceased to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>be necessary, Ida no longer resisted
the drowsiness, against which for
some time past she had found it so
difficult to contend. Besides, through
the opening of their resting-place she
could already discern the first faint
reddening of the approaching morn;
she therefore laid herself down by
Constantia’s side with the pleasing reflection,
that the cave would soon be
warmed and gladdened by the power
of the sun; and that when her still-slumbering
sister should open her eyes,
she would not behold those gloomy
appearances, which during that long
sad night had produced upon herself
such deep and melancholy impressions.</p>

<p class='c017'>Ida had not long closed her weary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>eye-lids, before Constantia awoke greatly
refreshed. Unconscious of the manner
in which her sister had past the night,
she lost no time in waking her, and
advising the prosecution of their journey.
Ida was contented with her short repose,
and obeyed the summons. Yet
before they quitted the hospitable
cavern, to whose shelter from the
night-blast they undoubtedly were indebted
for life, Ida led her sister to
the place, which had appeared to her
so awfully splendid when viewed at
midnight; but which (she doubted not)
would produce a different impression
than in those moments, when her
fortitude was completely subdued by
anxiety of mind and lassitude of
body.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>The beams of the morning-sun now
stained the waters of the Aar with
crimson light: its streams, as they
precipitated themselves into the vales
beneath, glowed with a thousand beautiful
colours. A shower of diamonds
seemed to fall from the summit of the
ice-rock, and the clifts, which during
the night had thrown such deep and
solemn shadows around them, now
were gaily arrayed in verdant moss
and covered with such hardy plants, as
can endure cold without inconvenience,
and which generally fasten their
roots in the fissures of stones and
among the broken crags of mountains.
The sight was at once majestic and
enlivening! the two pilgrims sank upon
their knees opposite to the newly-risen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>sun, and poured out the sentiments
of pious enthusiasm, with which
they felt their hearts overflow. Not
complaints, not murmurs, not sighs
proceeded from the lips of these poor
forlorn-ones: no; they exprest their
delight at this wonderful creation and
their admiration of its Creator, though
at that moment they were themselves
struggling against calamities so desperate,
as scarcely to afford them the
remote possibility of a rescue. Never
perhaps was a nobler sacrifice offered
up by suffering humanity to the power
and magnificence of the Supreme!</p>

<p class='c017'>Yet Ida’s sacrifice was the greatest,
since Constantia possest a source of
satisfaction in her bosom, of which her
sister was not yet aware.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>—“To-day,” said she, while her
countenance was brightened with smiles,
at the same time detaining Ida, who
(having finished her orisons,) was on the
point of turning from the cave; “to-day
it is my turn to be the guide through
our doubtful journey. Ida, I dreamt
last night, that we were still wandering
along the paths, which we traversed
yesterday: methought, that you went
foremost, and bewildered yourself in a
narrow nook, where precipices on all
sides impeded your further progress.
I was lamenting over your distress;
when lo! on a sudden St. Engeltruda
stood before me, such as she is represented
on the altar-piece in her Chapel
at Engelberg. A ray of golden light
detached itself from the aureol, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>blazed round her head, and guided
me to a small opening in a rock, exactly
resembling <i>that</i>, which caught my
eye in the first moment of my entering
this cavern. I past through it: a
narrow winding-way descended gradually
into the valley. Suddenly, as if it
had been by some magic spell, we were
transported into those happy plains,
where we past the years of infancy, and
which I shall never cease to regret our
ever leaving: there we became once
more Mary and Rosanna Tell, and
forgot in the humble tranquillity of
Rutelis the sorrows and sufferings of
our lofty hateful station.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>Ida gave way to the enthusiastic
hopes of her sister, and followed her, as
with difficulty she forced her way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>through a narrow opening, which she
had discovered at no great distance
from the torrent. After springing
boldly at the hazard of their lives over
a few wide-yawning chasms, they
reached a kind of green plain, where
it was possible for them to proceed
above a hundred yards without meeting
any obstacle. A circumstance so new
in their painful journey inspired Constantia
with added confidence. She
turned smiling to her sister, and pointed
out two small white butterflies, who
were sporting in the sunshine, and
which (she was firmly persuaded) were
the very same, whom she had seen
sinking exhausted to the ground on
the day before.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Yesterday,” said she with exultation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“yesterday they were the emblems
of our distress; to-day they are
the prophets of our speedy rescue. See,
see! a favourable western gale wafts
them kindly to the lower vallies, where
they may flutter through fields of flowers,
and forget how much they suffered
from the frost, while they bask in the
bright and cheering sunshine.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>Her long undisturbed night’s rest,
and her confidence in the protection of
her Patron-Saint had greatly improved
Constantia’s spirits: Ida’s on the contrary
were much more deprest than at
the beginning of their journey. They
soon reached the termination of their
easy road; and as fresh obstacles seemed
again to impede their progress with
every step, Ida asserted, that the difficulties,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>which they found in their present
path were sufficient to prove, that
they had judged ill in altering their
direction. It was in vain, that Constantia
attempted to demonstrate, that
the course, which she so much regretted,
would have led them into the most
remote recesses of the Grimsel-Mountain,
which towered above them on the <i>one</i>
side; or that she pointed out the Tempest-horn,
which rose on the other like
some threatening giant, and on whose
ice-covered limbs no path was discernable,
which could possibly have been
trodden by any mortal feet.</p>

<p class='c017'>A narrow passage between two almost
joining rocks guided them to the mountain
of Gemmi: and now they perceived
with joy, that instead of being
one unvaried acclivity, their road every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>now and then suffered them to descend.
It’s true, this road seemed rather calculated
for the clambering of goats, than
for the use of human beings: but though
it was frequently interrupted by extensive
chasms, they frequently found themselves
assisted in passing them by broad planks,
already laid over them by some friendly
hand. Where there were none, and the
Sisters were obliged to traverse the abyss
with extreme hazard on some narrow
shelf by clinging to the broken crags, still
Constantia never would proceed, till she
had discovered either an unemployed
plank, which she brought from some
other place, or the shattered branch of
some wild fig-tree; in order that she
might stretch it across the chasm, and
enable any future wanderer to cross it
with less trouble and risque. She also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>(as they proceeded onwards) began to
relate a wonderful legend, which had
been told her by one of the nuns of
Zurich, explaining, why of all these
mountains that of Gemmi alone was
observed never to be whitened with
snow or ice. But Ida was too much out
of heart, and too fearful of their being
engaged in a wrong direction, to permit
herself to pay much attention to the
legend; and as <i>she</i> did not think it
worth notice, there can be no sort
of occasion for my repeating it here.</p>

<p class='c017'>From a rock, whose height made their
heads giddy, they had ventured at mid-day
to cast their eyes down into the
regions beneath them, and which the
sinking heart of Ida now made her
despair of ever reaching. They could
perceive from hence several dark spots,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>which Ida pronounced to be abysses, in
which their path would at length terminate:
and this decision she delivered
with such positiveness, that Constantia
would undoubtedly have consented to
return, or else have chosen a different
path, had either a return been now
practicable, or another path been to be
found. But as the day advanced, and
the road still continued to sink itself
lower and lower, with what rapture did
they ascertain, that these supposed abysses
in fact were parts of a village; whose
smoking chimnies announced to them
the neighbourhood of domestic comforts,
and to whose peaceable shelter the cattle
were at that moment returning from
pasture.</p>

<p class='c017'>The quick-sighted Ida was the first to
make this discovery. She sank weeping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>upon the bosom of her sister, and
entreated her to forgive the wayward
humour, with which she had embittered
their journey. Constantia folded the
suppliant to her heart, and the Sisters
united in offering up a prayer of fervent
gratitude to the Saint, who had guided
their wanderings so wonderfully and so
well.</p>

<p class='c017'>They resumed their journey, and now
how easy did it seem to them! As they
descended, the path gradually enlarged
itself; and before the shutting in of
night they found themselves safe under
one of the cottage-roofs, where they
learned for the first time after a long,
long interval, what it was to rest without
anxiety: in truth the short and
broken slumbers, which visited them in
the robber-valley, were scarcely worthy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>of being called by the sweet name of
rest.</p>

<p class='c017'>While the Damsels of Werdenberg
were engaged in the above adventures;
while one of them was anxiously and
vainly expected at the Convent of Zurich,
and while the other was most unjustly
censured and despised for her supposed
elopement with the acknowledged bridegroom
of her friend; Count Henry of
Montfort was eagerly pursuing the
wrong track, into which he had been
enticed by the perfidious chaplain of
Castle-March. Persuaded that he should
soon overtake Ida, he continued to rush
forwards without allowing himself to
rest for a moment; till in a little village
belonging to the Canton of Glarus he
was attacked by a severe fever, produced
by the violence of his mental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>agitation, and by the inconsiderate
speed, with which his journey had
been performed. Nature at length
yielded, and Henry was compelled to
stop, and make his option either of
recovering slowly, or of dying at
once.</p>

<p class='c017'>According to the established custom
of all knight errants, he had commenced
his expedition, not merely without
forming a plan or consulting common
sense, but without furnishing himself
with a necessary supply of cash. He
had left all his attendants far behind him;
and as several days had elapsed since his
separation from them, and as he had
not thought proper to inform them of
the object of his journey, they were
totally unable to form even a guess as
to the place, where it would be most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>likely for them to rejoin their master.
Luckily for Henry, in the paroxysms of
his fever he frequently pronounced the
name of Montfort. From this the good
simple people of the village (who in
truth had rendered him all the assistance,
which their sorry means could
allow) concluded, that the invalid must
certainly belong to the old Count of
Montfort. A messenger was dispatched
to verify the fact: and Count Egbert
lost no time in sending able physicians
to his nephew’s aid, by whose care the
fever was at length vanquished. As
soon as the step could be taken without
endangering his life, the Convalescent
was removed to his paternal mansion,
where he saw nothing but frowning
countenances, and heard nothing from
morning till night, except reproaches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>for his extraordinary conduct on his
bridal day with Elizabeth. It seems,
that Count Egbert now thought himself
entitled to assume a higher tone of
authority with his nephew, since the
news was just arrived, that Henry’s
firm friend and powerful patron, the
Emperor, was no more. He perished,
in consequence of a malady which he
contracted during an expedition against
the Turks, and was no longer able to
vindicate and enforce the claims of his
favourite.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“You cannot but acknowledge,”
said the old Count one day to his pale
and still emaciated nephew, “that I
have done every thing in my power to
establish your happiness on a firm basis.
Elizabeth of March, young, lovely, wise,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>powerful, and (above all!) enormously
rich, would have been your own at
this moment, if you had not thought
proper to abandon her for the laudable
purpose of scampering away after a
will-o’-the-wisp!—But now the business
is over! No regrets can now put matters
to rights again! Elizabeth is
Countess of Torrenburg, is lost to you
for ever, and what counsel to give you
now, I protest, I know not!—Truly,
your affairs are in a wretched condition:
your claims on my succession cannot
avail you till after my decease; and
even then, they stand a fair chance of
being worth but little, since I am now
seriously thinking of contracting a matrimonial
engagement: though you
thought proper to break off my former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>match by running away with my intended
bride, the light and wanton
Ida!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>Here Henry assured him for the
twentieth time, that he had not beheld
Ida since the bridal day at the Castle of
March; and his uncle for the twentieth
time replied, by assuring Henry, that in
that case it was very extraordinary, that
nobody else should know any thing at
all about her. However, whether she
had gone off with Henry or with any
other person, for his own part he was determined,
that anxiety about her should
never turn one more hair of his head
grey; but that he would marry the first
woman of a decent family, whom luck
or accident should throw into his way.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the course of his reproaches the
old Count had mentioned Elizabeth’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>marriage: this was a fact. Within a
few days after Ida’s disappearance, Elizabeth
became Countess of Torrenburg.
It has already been mentioned, that
Count Frederick set forward for the
Castle of March, in all the pomp of a
bridegroom, to renew his addresses,
fortified by an encouraging vision of his
patron-saint, and assisted by the prayers
of the worthy Father Hilarius. On the
other hand, the house-priest of March
had managed to screw the indignation
of Elizabeth and her relations to the
highest pitch against the fugitive Montfort
and the Heiresses of Sargans; and
the lady’s parents were proportionably
penitent for the ill-judged rejection of
Count Frederick’s addresses. Finding
his mistress and her friends in a temper
of mind so favourable to his wishes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>the superannuated lover needed only to
make his proposals, in order to have
them accepted.  But little discussion
was necessary; all parties were soon of
the same mind, and Elizabeth in a few
days entered the Castle of Torrenburg
as its mistress. From that hour her
every word, her every action was such,
as proved her to be worthy of the high
station, in which she was placed by the
choice of this excellent nobleman;
against whom no possible objection
could be suggested, except that he was
old enough to be the grand-father of
his blooming wife. But to Elizabeth’s
disappointed heart his age was rather a
recommendation than an objection.
After Montfort’s perfidy she felt it
impossible for her ever to love another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>man as her husband; but she loved
Count Frederick as her father; she
esteemed and reverenced him, nor from
her conduct towards him would any
one have supposed, that her happy husband
was not still in possession of all
the advantages and charms of youth.
All affection for the ungrateful Henry
seemed extinguished in her bosom, and
the good old Count enjoyed with her a
much greater share of happiness, than
he had any reason to expect would have
been the case. Nor was her behaviour
towards her husband alone praiseworthy:
she conducted herself on all
occasions with so much discretion, and
displayed throughout such winning
graces and enlarged benevolence, that
she became the object of universal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>respect, and was proposed as a model to
be admired and imitated by all the
daughters of Helvetia.</p>

<p class='c017'>In one point alone her prudence was
in default. There was an individual in
the Castle of Torrenburg, whose influence
with her husband was omnipotent; but
for whom she felt an aversion so insurmountable,
that scarcely could she endure
him in her presence; and whom she
was rash enough to endeavour at removing,
before she had examined whether
her strength was equal to the undertaking,
and whether this offence
offered to the antient household gods,
might not draw down some heavy
punishment upon her own unsuspecting
head.</p>

<p class='c017'>This detested and persecuted object
of Elizabeth’s efforts was no other, than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>the keeper of all the consciences in the
Castle of Torrenburg, was no other
than the devout Father Hilarius! She
was not aware, that it was to him and
his saints, that she was chiefly indebted
for the illustrious title which she bore,
and the splendid station which she occupied.
Perhaps, even had she been
conscious of her obligation, she would
have but little approved of the crooked
paths, by which the Friar had contrived
to conduct her to her elevated situation.</p>

<p class='c017'>In fulfilment of his vow, Count Frederick
had recompensed the patron-saints
of his two clerical allies most liberally
for the possession of his adored Elizabeth.
The chaplain of Castle-March
(whose only capital fault was avarice)
was well contented with the reward of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>his exertions: not so was Hilarius!
He had formed far greater plans, and
indulged more glorious expectations.
He had made no sort of doubt, that he
should gain no less a share of the wife’s
confidence, than he already possest of
the husband’s. Instead of this, he obtained
from her nothing but aversion
and contempt; and from the moment
of his being convinced, that such were
her sentiments towards him, fury took
entire possession of his misanthropic
heart, and he brooded day and night
over plans of swift-coming vengeance.</p>

<p class='c017'>His disappointment in the present was
greatly embittered by his foreseeing the
failure of all those hopes, which he had
long grounded upon the future. Much
time had not elapsed since his marriage,
when the superannuated Frederick communicated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>to the chaplain in confidence
certain dispositions of his estates after
his death, which could not fail to be
highly disagreeable to the avaricious
Monk. Every day more fascinated by
the perfections of his beautiful wife, the
Count tortured himself to discover
some means, by which he might express
in the most striking manner his gratitude
to her, whose attentions shed a
gleam of such bright sunshine over the
evening of his closing life. He secretly
bequeathed to her every thing, which it
was possible for him to give, without
entirely laying aside all justice to the
young Countesses of Werdenberg: since
much as he held himself insulted by
their late conduct, still he was too generous
to deprive them of any thing, to
which the name which they bore could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>enable them to advance the claims of
justice.</p>

<p class='c017'>His confessor was initiated into all
these mysteries. Scarcely while he
listened to them, could Hilarius restrain
his rage within the bounds of decency.
He saw all the fond hopes, which he had
built upon Frederick’s want of heirs
and attachment to the church and its
servants, destroyed at one blow; and
he gnashed his teeth for spite to think,
that it was out of his power to prevent
the Count’s benevolent intentions towards
his wife from being carried into
immediate and complete effect.</p>

<p class='c017'>As for Elizabeth, she was entirely
ignorant of those weighty proofs of his
affection, which Count Frederick designed
for her after his decease. She was
equally ignorant of the spite and envy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>which this large bequest had excited
against her in one of the most malignant
of human hearts. She continued to proceed
in her straight-forward benevolent
course without turning to the right or to
the left: she treated her decrepit husband
with unabated kindness and attention
unwearied; and she denied herself no
opportunity of convincing Hilarius, that
he was the object of her fixed aversion,
and that she was decidedly bent on procuring
sooner or later his expulsion
from the Castle of Torrenburg.</p>

<p class='c017'>Oh! that she had carried that design
into execution before one of the basest
attempts, that ever was plotted by a
villain’s brain, was ripe enough for
action! Yet perhaps the will of Heaven
ordained, that this plan should be suffered
to ripen, in order that it might effect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>the overthrow of its guilty author, and
exhibit the merits of the noble lady of
the Castle in the fullest blaze of all their
purity and lustre!</p>

<p class='c017'>Oh! generous Elizabeth! you for
whom I write, and for whom I trust,
that I have not written in vain! Is it
permitted me to relate your own glorious
actions to yourself? Yet why
do I hesitate?—She, who (I doubt not)
while perusing these leaves has not hesitated
to bestow many a tear of compassion
on the undeserved sorrows, many
a tribute of admiration on the heroic
patience, many an expression of delight
and gratitude at the fortunate escape,
of those whom she calls—“<i>her enemies</i>,”—surely
<i>she</i> need not avert her eyes,
while my faithful hand places her before
the glass, in which she may behold the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>reflection of her own excellence! She
knows well, that I am no flatterer. I
have not concealed from her, that she is
proud, rash, not disinclined to resentment
for injuries, and obstinate in
adhering to her determinations, however
inconsiderately those determinations
may have been formed. But
neither will I conceal, that I know her
to be generous, benevolent, courageous,
resolute, disinterested; an avowed
enemy of vice, however fascinating be
the shape which it assumes; an enthusiastic
adorer of virtue, however humble
be the station which it occupies, however
lowly be the habit which it wears. Such
is the faint portrait of her, whom future
historians will paint in far more brilliant
colours; such is the portrait of Elizabeth
of Torrenburg!</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>Hilarius had long been secretly connected
with a society of mountaineers,
who (by means of the private entrance
to the Donat-Fortress) might be reckoned
the Count’s nearest neighbours.
The precise nature of this union between
the Monk and the Banditti belongs to
the secret history of these miscreants,
in which we are not sufficiently well
instructed to authorize our giving any
account of it in these memoirs. Let it
suffice, that the union was a very close
one; perhaps, it was a long-established
custom for the robbers to connect themselves
with some ecclesiastic, in memory
of the original founder of their society,
the celebrated Abbot Luprian. Alas!
it is a very painful task for me, myself
an ecclesiastic, the successor of that
Abbot Luprian, the cotemporary of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>Monk Hilarius, to point out the stains,
with which the vices of individuals have
polluted the sacred habit!—Yet it is
essential, that the whole truth should be
laid before Elizabeth’s eyes, and I will
not hesitate to perform my duty to the
full.</p>

<p class='c017'>The avarice of Hilarius was insatiable.
The custody of that deserted quarter of
the Count’s residence, which was now
only known by the name of the Donat-Fortress,
was intrusted to him; nothing
could be more convenient for the robbers
than such a retreat, where they
could either take refuge, when the
pursuit after them was too hot to admit
of their venturing back to their valley;
or where they could remain concealed
and unsuspected of being in the neighbourhood,
till the precise moment should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>arrive for executing their plans of
devastation with the most complete
success. Accordingly, no sum appeared
to them to counterbalance the value of
such a refuge; and Hilarius annually
received an immense tribute for allowing
them the use of the subterraneous passage,
and also of such of the apartments
of the Donat-Fortress, as were best
adapted to their purposes and profession.
Here they had a well-appointed armoury;
here they deposited their prey,
till circumstances admitted of its removal
to the valley; and here (among many
other precautions for their safety) they
had not neglected to lay in a large stock
of provisions, and above all several
hogsheads of the best old Rhenish
wine.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>But though they did not neglect any
occasion of increasing their wealth by
the plunder of passengers and of the
country at large, still there was one vast
undertaking, which lay most at the
hearts of <i>the Warriors of the Mountains</i>;
for that was the title, by which the
free-booters preferred being distinguished.—Of
this undertaking Hilarius was
the original suggestor, and without his
aid they were well aware, that it never
could be carried into execution. The
object of it was nothing less, than to put
the Warriors of the Mountains in possession
of the whole domains of the Count
of Torrenburg, with the exception of such
parts as his pious enthusiasm should have
induced him to bequeath to the Convent,
of which Hilarius was a worthy member.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>The plans were so well arranged, that
nothing could seem more improbable
than a failure: nothing indeed prevented
their having been already carried
into execution except the immoderate
price, which Hilarius demanded in
recompense of his services.</p>

<p class='c017'>Matters, however, were so nearly concluded
between the contracting parties,
that Hilarius had occasionally introduced
some of the principal robbers into the
Castle in various disguises, in order
that they might become thoroughly
acquainted with the nature of the place,
which they were to attack; might spy
out the weaker parts of its defences;
and by being aware of the obstacles to
their designs, might be prepared to
overcome them. Confiding in the terrific
tales respecting the ghosts, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>haunted it, he had even ventured frequently
to give his allies midnight
entertainments in the deserted chambers
of the Donat-Fortress. The superstitious
domestics shook with terror, as
they saw gleams of light streaming
through the worm-eaten casements,
and doubted not, that the ghosts of the
antient tyrants of Carlsheim and Sargans
had invited all the other infernal
spirits to a feast in their former earthly
residence. In this manner had the
Count’s enemies frequently been within
a few hundred yards of him unsuspected;
while he (good man) was dreaming,
that his barred portals and lifted draw-bridge
secured him against any possible
attack.</p>

<p class='c017'>Yet his good fortune so ordained it,
that the striking this important blow,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>was still delayed from time to time:
Hilarius too was of opinion, that the
fittest time for making the long-meditated
attack would be immediately after
the Count’s decease, when the want of
lineal heirs must necessarily produce
much confusion among the numerous
claimants, and when in all probability the
Castle’s inhabitants would be found
entirely off their guard. The impatient
robbers were by no means satisfied with
this opinion: they were for making the
attempt immediately; but unless they
could convince Hilarius, their opposition
availed them nothing. He consented
to their taking possession of the Donat-Fortress;
but he took care to keep it
well locked and bolted, so that the
supposed spectres could not by any
means invade the inhabited part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>Castle, till it should be his own good
will and pleasure to admit them.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was at this period, that the Countesses
of Werdenberg were acknowledged
by Count Frederick, and were
immediately considered by the Monk
as obstacles to his designs. Looking
upon Constantia as destined to the veil,
his whole undivided hatred was monopolized
by Ida; and he never rested,
till he had ruined her in her uncle’s
good opinion, nay (by means of her
mysterious flight) in the good opinion
of the world. I have already related,
in what manner he delivered her into
the power of the robbers; who gratified
him doubly, first by relieving him
from a person whose absence he wished,
and whose blood he was not quite
villain enough to shed with his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>hands, and secondly by rewarding him
for the possession of so lovely a girl
with a considerable sum of money.</p>

<p class='c017'>As to what became afterwards of
the unhappy Ida, that was a matter of
little interest to Father Hilarius: but
it would have been a matter of very
<i>great</i> interest, if he had guest Randolf’s
intention of giving himself a
legal claim to the inheritance of Sargans
by the possession of her hand, and of
reinstating the detested Ida hereafter
in those rights, of which the Monk had
taken so much trouble to deprive
her.</p>

<p class='c017'>The daily presents, which Frederick’s
generosity bestowed on his spiritual
guide, made the latter by no means
anxious to see the moment of his
patron’s dissolution. He had forwarded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>to the utmost of his power Elizabeth’s
marriage, not only on account of the
advantages promised both to himself
and his Convent by the superannuated
lover, whenever this union should be
accomplished, but also from being persuaded,
that the affectionate care of
such a wife would be giving the Count
a new lease for many years of existence.</p>

<p class='c017'>But when the Monk perceived Elizabeth’s
decided aversion to himself, and
that her remonstrances had already
produced a degree of coolness in her
husband towards both his person and his
counsels, he found it necessary to hasten
the execution of his plans. The venom
of spite and vengeance, which had so
long been working in his heart, at
length overflowed; the glimmering
sparks of treason broke into flames;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>his intercourse with the Warriors of the
Mountain grew more close than ever;
and the peaceable inhabitants of the
Castle were almost terrified out of their
senses at the frequent feasts given by
the ghosts of the antient Lords of
Sargans.</p>

<p class='c017'>The reports relative to the goblins
of the Donat-Fortress at length reached
Elizabeth. She had the rashness on
one of these terrific nights, when all
the other inmates of the Castle went
about obstinately with their eyes and
ears shut, as obstinately to keep hers
wide open. Unattended, she ventured
to approach the deserted chambers; and
the sounds which reached her, as she
stood without, convinced her, that if
they really proceeded from spirits, those
spirits must needs have retained a considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>portion of their former earthly
habits.</p>

<p class='c017'>Not the most distant suspicion of
what really was the occasion of this
uproar, was likely to suggest itself to
her mind. She only concluded, and
very naturally, that the belief in apparitions
served some of her domestics
as a cloak to hide their midnight and
dissolute entertainments from the
knowledge of their superiors. This
was a practice, to which as mistress of
the family she thought it absolutely
necessary to put an immediate stop.
Accordingly, without loss of time she
informed her husband of what she had
observed, and of what she supposed to
be the fact: the household was immediately
summoned, and ordered to
attend their Lord and Lady to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>haunted chambers, which they were
determined to examine without a moment’s
delay.</p>

<p class='c017'>But the uninvited guests were already
aware of their approach. One of Elizabeth’s
women was in the confidence of
the Monk, and hastened to warn him
by a signal previously agreed upon, that
danger was at hand. Hilarius immediately
insisted, that the lights should
be extinguished, and that the Banditti
should retire with all speed through
the secret passage, which (he asserted)
would be the most spirit-like way of
taking their departure. But the robbers,
who were heated with wine, declared,
that it was high time for them to lay
aside the characters of spirits, and that
they never should find a more prosperous
moment for making their long-meditated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>attack, than the present.
The continual postponement of this
attack had long made them suspect
their ally of playing them false, and
they had prepared themselves for taking
the power out of his hands with the
very first favourable opportunity—the
caverns below were filled with Banditti:
those who were in the fortress were no
inconsiderable number; and confident
of a fresh supply of troops if necessary,
they rushed forwards to meet the
Lord of the Castle, without deigning
to summon to their assistance their
friends in the cavern. Indeed, they
looked upon victory not only as certain,
but easy, when their only antagonists
were terrified domestics, headed by no
better generals than an inexperienced
female, and a gray-headed man just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>escaped from the bed of sickness, and
weighed down by the number of his
years. Accordingly, without listening
to the Monk’s remonstrances, they
rushed towards the great portal; and
Elizabeth with her followers no sooner
entered the court, in which the Donat-Fortress
was situated, than to their
utter surprize they found themselves
attacked on all sides.</p>

<p class='c017'>How lively were the colours, in
which the enraptured Frederick described
to me this the most glorious
transaction of Elizabeth’s life!—with
what enthusiasm did <i>he</i> relate, with
what enthusiasm did <i>I</i> hear, how in
this moment of consternation Elizabeth
alone preserved her presence of mind
and the look of undaunted resolution;
how, when her terrified attendants recoiled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>at the approach of the supposed
spectres, she showed them the sword,
which gleamed in the weak hands of
their aged master, urged them to
defend a life so precious, and shamed
them by reproaches into following his
example; how she wrested from the
hand of a beardless robber the weapon,
which he already pointed against her
husband’s heart, and instantly buried it
in the assassin’s own; how when the
weak old Frederick was at length struck
to the earth, she threw herself before
him, and made her breast his shield;
and how while occupied in this generous
office, and while thus devoting her
own life in order to preserve his, she
received a wound upon her brow,
whose scar now forms the noblest ornament
of the most lovely face in all
Helvetia!</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>Frederick was wounded, and his
attendants conveyed him away from the
scene of action; but Elizabeth still
maintained her post, directing by her
advice, and invigorating by her presence
the small but faithful body of her
retainers. The Banditti found by this
time, that victory was not to be so
easily gained, as they had hitherto expected;
and they thought it prudent
to summon to their assistance the
lurkers in the subterraneous caverns.
Elizabeth perceived, that the numbers
of the assailants was suddenly and
alarmingly increased. Every moment
seemed to add to their strength, and
it was evident, that unless some means
of preventing the foe from profiting by
this new accession of power could be
discovered, every thing was lost.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>Fortunately, in this critical moment the
eye of the Heroine rested upon the
portcullis, which on account both of
its weight and workmanship was
esteemed a master-piece of art. She
sprang forwards; she still grasped the
sword, of which she had deprived the
robber, and with a single blow she
severed the sustaining cord. It fell
with a heavy crash, and destroyed in
its descent several of the new-comers,
who were over-hasty in flying to
the assistance of their hardly-pressed
companions.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Courage, my friends!” exclaimed
Elizabeth with a sudden burst of joy;
“resist your enemies but for a few
minutes longer, and we are safe! hark,
how the alarm-bells make the air resound!
and see! the castle-portals are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>thrown open! rejoice! rejoice! our
preservers are at hand!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>It had been one of the Countess’s
first orders, that the alarm-bells should
be sounded without delay, and as soon
as any signs were observed of obedience
to the signal for assistance, that the
Warder should set wide the gates for
the reception of those, who might
hasten to their relief. She was obeyed;
but no one expected, that these precautions
would bring them any more
powerful succour than the presence of
a few bands of peasants, armed in haste,
and unaccustomed to such midnight
attacks; or else perhaps the troops of
some of the neighbouring noblemen,
but who were all at too great a distance
to admit of their reaching the Castle
of Torrenburg, before the business
should have been finally decided.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>But Elizabeth, when she gave these
orders, was better aware of their importance.
The terrible event, which I
have just been describing, took place
on the night preceding St. Martin’s
festival. St. Martin’s day was also the
birth-day of the Count of Torrenburg;
a day, which Elizabeth now celebrated
for the first time, since she became a
wife, and which she was determined to
distinguish by a most splendid entertainment.
For many weeks had her
messengers been employed in traversing
the neighbouring provinces, for the
purpose of inviting the most distinguished
noblemen and their families to
be present at a tournament, to be held
at the Castle of Torrenburg in honour
of the nativity of its Lord. Count
Frederick, though he was now too much
enfeebled by age to admit of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>taking a part in them himself, still
delighted in witnessing such martial
sports: they recalled to him many a
pleasing and many a glorious occurrence
of his honourable life; and Elizabeth
had not failed to select for his amusement
on his birth-day that particular
species, which, her own observation
and the experience of others had given
her reason to know, would be most
acceptable to her husband.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was on this very night, that the
invited guests were expected at the
Castle, accompanied by their wives and
daughters with a numerous retinue.
It had been settled, that they should not
arrive till after midnight, in order that
their being in the Castle might continue
unknown to the Count till the
next morning; when it was Elizabeth’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>design to conduct him (still
ignorant of what was going to take
place) to the prepared lists, where he
would unexpectedly find himself seated
in the circle of his best friends and
well-wishers, in order to witness that
kind of entertainment, in which he
most peculiarly delighted. All her
preparations had been made with the
greatest secrecy; none but a few of
her most immediate friends and domestics
were in her confidence; and
therefore few except herself were aware,
that the alarm-bells were sounded for
the purpose of calling to her assistance
those expected guests, who (she was
certain from the lateness of the hour)
must needs be at no great distance.</p>

<p class='c017'>Her hopes were soon verified. The
draw-bridge had scarcely fallen, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>it re-echoed under the hasty trampling
of horses’-hoofs. The court-yard was
soon filled with soldiers, who without
staying to demand what was the matter,
hastened with drawn swords to assist
the Countess and her faithful supporters.
Elizabeth was a heroine in the
moment of need; but her heart was
still that of a weak and tender female.
She was anxious to rejoin her bleeding
husband; her wound was painful; and
still more painful to her feelings was
the sight of the blood, which streamed
around her, and of the mangled corses
with which the pavement was strewed.
Most joyful was she, when she found
herself at liberty to resign her dangerous
and hateful post; her friend of
youth, Richard of Ulmenhorst, and
Count Oswald of March (her brother)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>took the command of her forces; and
she now flew to the chamber of that
husband, who but a few minutes before
had been indebted to her for his life.
She found, that his wound (it was but
a slight one) was already drest; and
that he was earnestly insisting, that his
attendants should lead him to rejoin
his glorious wife, and suffer him either
to conquer by her side, or perish with
that dear one: they sank into each
other’s arms, and melted into tears of
joy at finding themselves once more in
safety. Seldom have youthful lovers,
even in their happiest moments, felt
such unmixed pleasure, as was now felt
by Elizabeth, while she clasped the
decrepit Frederick to her heart.</p>

<p class='c017'>Before day-break the victory was
complete. The knights, who had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>invited to a mock-fight, and had found
one so serious, did not leave their work
only half finished—the portcullis was
raised again; every corner of the Donat-Fortress
was investigated: the entrance
to the subterraneous vaults was found
open and unguarded, and these also
underwent an examination. Here a
considerable number of the free-booters
were discovered, and after an obstinate
resistance slaughtered; but a few of
them found means to effect their escape
from the caverns, and carried the news
of this disaster to their associates in
the valley of Halsberg.</p>

<p class='c017'>Gero was one of the first, who fell
in the assault; Randolf was taken
prisoner: as to the author of all this
mischief, the infamous Hilarius, he was
found to all appearance lifeless in one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>of the caverns, whither he had retreated
during the heat of the combat. He
had suffered so severely both in the
conflict, and from the pressure of those,
who (like himself) crowded to take
refuge in the secret vaults, that though
life was not quite extinct in him, he
expired, before he had time to acknowledge
his numerous transgressions, and
receive their absolution. My knowledge
of his private transactions and
views was gleaned from the writings,
which were afterwards found in his
chamber, and in his cell at the Convent,
of which he was so unworthy a member.
These papers were confided to me by
the Bishop of Coira; and their contents
were such as rendered them highly
improper to meet the eyes of the
laity; who are already but too apt to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>scoff, when a church-man slips, and
from whom the servants of Religion
ought carefully to veil the errors of
her unsteady children.—But the love
of truth, the interests of justice, and the
welfare of two poor persecuted creatures,
made it necessary for me to place
everything in the clearest light before
the eyes of her, who (I am certain)
needs only to be convinced, that they
are <i>really</i> persecuted, in order to become
their most strenuous defender.</p>

<p class='c017'>So entirely had their evil star the
ascendant, that even this overthrow of
their enemies only served to make the
Sisters appear in the eyes of the world
in a still more odious point of view.
Hilarius died without having time to
acknowledge the pains, which he had
taken to effect Ida’s ruin: it was not till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>lately, that I obtained the certainty of
the Monk’s perfidy, and of the innocence
of my poor wards; facts appeared
so strong against her, that even I for
a considerable time was compelled to
give up the fruitless office of defending
her; and the proofs, which spoke so loudly
in her disfavour, seemed to increase
in number with every fresh occurrence.
Several of the robbers had been made
prisoners, and underwent a close examination
respecting the authors of their
enterprize and its object. Among
other things, they confest, that a damsel,
understood to be a Countess of Werdenberg,
had made a long abode in
their society; that she was evidently
the object of their captain’s affection;
and that it was reported among the
Banditti, that she had consented to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>become his wife, on condition of his
establishing her claims to the domains
of Sargans and Carlsheim by force of
arms. Randolf, being questioned respecting
these assertions, in a great
measure confirmed them; he only
denied, that Ida had ever given her
consent in express words to the enterprize;
but he profest his firm belief,
that on those conditions he had every
reason to believe her disposed to unite
her fate with his. He had dropped
such plain hints of his designs against
the Count, that she could not possibly
have misunderstood him, though her discretion
made her prefer the appearing
ignorant of a scheme, whose object was
the ruin of her former benefactor: but
as she must have gathered his intention
from various circumstances, and as she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>continued to treat him, not merely
with unabated, but even with increased
complaisance, he had certainly good
reason to suppose, that his meditated
plan was by no means disagreeable to
her.—Alas! poor Ida! had she dared
to abate that complaisance, and to express
the sentiments of abhorrence, with
which the robber’s views inspired her,
what would have been her reward?—ill
usage; death perhaps; or what
would have been still worse, life with
the loss of honour!</p>

<p class='c017'>But these reflections did not occur
to Randolf or his hearers; they believed
his arguments to be well founded, and
that Ida had approved of the design,
which had so nearly terminated her
benefactor’s existence. That she had
been privy to it, is true: she had not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>misunderstood Randolf’s hints, though
she was not aware of the exact nature
of his intentions; but no sooner was
she in safety, than her first object was
to provide for that of the Count of
Torrenburg.</p>

<p class='c017'>The village, which at length afforded
them security and rest, was called Edel-Bothen:
here they were compelled to
pass the night and the succeeding morning,
in order to recover from the
fatigues of their late painful journey;
and it was from hence, that a messenger
was dispatched to the Castle of Torrenburg
with a letter, written by Constantia
in a disguised hand and without
a signature. Ida, who still trembled at
the thoughts of being either compelled
to give her hand to the old Count of
Montfort, or to seclude herself for life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>within the dreary walls of a cloister,
was unwilling to let her incensed uncle
know, where she might be found;
and Constantia, though she had herself
no motive for concealment, was afraid
of being the means of discovering her
sister. With much difficulty, and after
many unsuccessful attempts, the following
lines were at length completed,
and a peasant was dispatched with them
to the Castle of Torrenburg.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c006' />
</div>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><i>Count of Torrenburg!</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Peruse these lines from an unknown
but sincere friend, who trembles, lest the
warning should come too late. In your
domestic priest, the worthless Hilarius,
you nourish a traitor, whose plans if
successful will terminate in your destruction.
He has already driven many
innocent persons into the jaws of ruin:
and now to finish his career with a
master stroke of villainy, he meditates
the overthrow of his generous benefactor.
Secure him, and let him and
his papers undergo a strict examination.
Above all, set a watch over the Donat-Fortress,
and let the private entrance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>be carefully closed up, which you will
find on the left hand of the window in
the large chamber, which terminates the
southern wing of the ruins. That
entrance communicates with a subterraneous
passage, well known to the robbers,
who have so long been the terror
of Helvetia, and with whom Hilarius
carries on the most intimate correspondence.
Hasten then to prevent their
making any ill use of their knowledge
of this communication; and if this
warning should be in time to save you
from danger, the writers of this letter
will thank Heaven as for a benefit conferred
upon themselves.</p>

<hr class='c020' />

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>This well-meant epistle did not reach
the Castle of Torrenburg till several
days after St. Martin’s day. It was read
aloud at the Count’s table, when the hall
was almost filled with knights and ladies,
who were assembled there on account
of the festivities, with which Elizabeth
thought it right to celebrate her Lord’s
escape from the perilous Banditti. The
letter, while reading, was frequently
interrupted by loud bursts of scornful
laughter and expressions of derision
from the whole assembly; yet ’tis said,
that Frederick and Elizabeth did not
laugh, and were quite silent. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>easily guest, from whom this unavailing
warning came; and Count Oswald of
March, (whose family pride had been
stung to the quick by young Montfort’s
conduct on the bridal day, and whose
affection for his sister made him the
inveterate enemy of any one, who
offered her any injury or unkindness)
insisted upon being allowed to answer
the letter.</p>

<p class='c017'>According to her instructions, Ida’s
messenger had no sooner delivered the
letter, than he hastened away from the
Castle: but two horsemen were dispatched
after him in all haste, and the
peasant was compelled to return for an
answer. That answer pained the Sisters
to the very heart; they preserved it
carefully; they read it over and over
again, and every time with fresh pain;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>and they at length showed it to me, as
a proof of their total renunciation by
their uncle. Count Oswald had written
as follows.</p>

<hr class='c020' />

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>The fair Ida’s well-conceived letter
arrived at the very time, which she intended;
that is, when it was too late to
be of any use. First to invent schemes
of treachery, and then when they fail,
to assume the part of a warning friend
against those very schemes, was certainly
one of the most dexterous artifices,
that ever was produced by female
ingenuity! Unfortunately, there are
some people, who are not deceived even
by artifices so dexterous. The Count
of Torrenburg has been rescued from
the Banditti, not by the fair Ida’s warning
<i>after</i> the event had taken place, but
by the courage and affection of an angel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>whose name was once Elizabeth of
March; whose name would have been
Elizabeth of Montfort, had it not been
for the fair Ida’s coquetry; and whose
name is now Elizabeth of Torrenburg,
in spite of all the pains, which the fair
Ida gave herself to prevent her ever
bearing that illustrious title. Yes! Elizabeth
is Countess of Torrenburg: I
protest, I cannot but pity the poor damsel
Ida for so severe a disappointment, as
this union must give to her views upon
Count Frederick’s inheritance. Besides
the loss of her benefactor’s good opinion,
she has also to regret that of her lover
the robber Randolf, who inhabits one of
the Count’s dungeons; so that all her
hopes in that quarter are completely
annihilated. It seems too, that she has
not even contrived to secure the light and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>worthless heart of Henry of Montfort,
who (probably grown already weary of
her) has returned to his uncle’s residence;
as report says, a sincere penitent
for having suffered himself to lose such
a treasure as the hand and heart of
Elizabeth through the artifices of a perfidious
coquette. Probably by this time
the fair Ida has found out, that this
maxim contains more truth than she
supposed; viz. “that crooked paths
lead to precipices.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Randolf, the fair Ida’s lover, is a
prisoner; Henry of Montfort, the fair
Ida’s dupe, has recovered his senses;
Gero and Hilarius, the fair Ida’s friends,
are both dead; and Count Frederick, the
fair Ida’s intended victim, is aware, that
Hilarius is not the only snake, whom he
has warmed in his bosom.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>Count Frederick of Torrenburg sends
the fair Ida his best wishes for her
speedy repentance, and ventures to
suggest, that a convent will be in future
her fittest residence.—He begs however,
that this may only be considered as his
<i>advice</i>; since looking upon her no
longer as his relation, he has no longer
any right to give her a command. At
all events, he begs, that whether she
takes that advice or not, she will not
think it necessary to inform him of her
proceedings, since he has now but one
wish on earth respecting her; to hear of
her no more!</p>

<hr class='c020' />

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>Ida’s tears streamed plentifully,
while she read these cutting lines. She
gave the letter in silence to Constantia,
who felt the unmerited reproaches no
less acutely than her sister. A long
pause ensued, which at length was
broken by Constantia.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“There is no mention made of <i>me</i>!”
said she,—“no more, than if I were no
longer in existence!—Well! well! it
is better to be quite forgotten, than to
be so remembered!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>—“How could they guess,” exclaimed
Ida, “that <i>I</i> was the writer of
that letter?—a letter, which He, who
sees the heart, can witness for me, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>wrote out of pure good will to my
unkind uncle.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>—“And how strange,” rejoined
Constantia, “that they should misunderstand
your character so completely,
as to believe you capable of such perfidy!
And how cruel of them to insult
your misfortunes by such an unfeeling
taunting letter!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>With such inquiries did they torture
themselves during a whole tedious day;
and they endeavoured in vain to discover,
what part of Ida’s conduct could
have authorised a man, who had once
shown her so much benevolence, to
view her on a sudden in a light so perfectly
odious. It appeared too from this
letter, that Count Frederick’s ill opinion
of her was also the opinion of the
world; and what had she done to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>deserve this universal ill opinion?—The
Sisters were not aware, that a prejudice
once conceived gains strength with every
minute, and presses into its services the
most insignificant occurrences: till the
supposed offence from a molehill is
swelled into a mountain, and shade
added to shade gradually makes the
detested object appear in colours sufficiently
black, to <i>justify</i> its being made
the object of detestation.</p>

<p class='c017'>No mention had been made of Constantia
in Count Oswald’s letter, because
on the one hand her gentle inoffensive
manners had prevented her having
any enemies; and on the other
hand, her supposed participation in her
sister’s plans prevented the parties concerned
from being her friends.—It
appeared, that after quitting the Castle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>of March on the memorable day of
Elizabeth’s intended wedding she had
not thought proper to return to her
convent. She had been way-laid by
those robbers, who (as it was now
believed) were at that very time in confederacy
with her sister. No one
doubted, that the free-booters had acted
under Ida’s directions, and with Constantia’s
concurrence; that the latter
was totally under the influence of the
former; and that if the one sister was
not quite so deserving of censure as
the other, she was at least equally unworthy
of protection. It was concluded,
that she was at that moment
Ida’s companion; and it was agreed by
all, that the most proper mode of treating
her, was not to bestow on her even
the slightest notice.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>When the bitterness of the first shock
was over, the Sisters found, that they
had no reason to consider their situation
as at all altered for the worse by the
perusal of this insulting letter. It had
not been in their contemplation to effect
a reconciliation with the Count of Torrenburg;
after so much as they had
suffered, they no longer indulged a wish
for any thing except retirement and repose.
Ida’s resentment against her
lover, for having offered his hand to
Elizabeth, was not yet appeased: and
after the injurious suspicions, to which
her conduct at the Castle of March had
(as she learned from Count Oswald’s
letter) given rise, she thought it highly
incumbent on her to make no inquiries
respecting him. She accordingly resolved
to verify the remainder of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>sister’s fortunate vision, and re-assume
the name of Rosanna Tell.—Constantia
for a while refused to follow her example,
and declared her determination of
hiding herself for ever from the world
in the Convent of Engelberg: but Ida
besought her, with so much earnestness
and with so many tears, “not to deprive
her of the society of the only person,
who still loved her, and whom she
still dared to love,” that Constantia was
compelled however reluctantly to give
way.</p>

<p class='c017'>A ring of some value, which Ida wore
on the day, which made her a captive,
and of which Randolf’s respect had
prevented his depriving her, purchased a
small hut and garden, in which the
Countesses of Werdenberg were but too
happy to obtain a shelter. Here then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>they remained in tranquil obscurity,
unknowing and unknown: till the
decease of the Count of Torrenburg and
its consequences compelled them once
more to take a part in the world, and
again become acquainted with its splendours,
and its cares.</p>

<p class='c017'>By the will of Count Frederick, the
whole of his domains descended to his
wife; the Damsels of Werdenberg were
disinherited, nor was this sufficient.
A clause of the most disgraceful import
declared the Count’s reasons for renouncing
them, and thus held them up
to the world as proper marks for the
finger of contempt. It seems, that there
still existed a younger branch of the
House of Werdenberg, but with whose
members the Sisters had never held any
intercourse. The ignominious clause in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>Count Frederick’s will greatly offended
the pride of these high-born noblemen.
That any persons belonging to their
family should deserve to be mentioned
upon record in such opprobrious terms,
appeared to them the most intolerable
of all offences; and they vowed never
to rest, till they had compelled the
delinquents to renounce their title to a
name, which (till they assumed it) had
never been stained with disgrace.—They
agitated this business with so
much effect, that at length an act was
obtained from the Emperor, enjoining
two Damsels calling themselves by the
names of Ida and Constantia, Countesses
of Werdenberg, to lay aside those titles,
as having forfeited them by their disgraceful
conduct, even supposing that
they really possest by birth a right to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>bear them; a fact, of which, the act professed
to doubt the veracity.—It also
forbade the reception of the said Damsels
into any religious community, except
such as were specified by name, and
which were those only, whose institution
(as was universally known) permitted
the acceptance of persons of
dissolute characters for the laudable
purpose of reformation.</p>

<p class='c017'>The Lords of Werdenberg were so
diligent in making this act public, that
it even reached the obscure valley, in which
the Sisters had sheltered themselves
under borrowed names. Little
as they valued the pride of birth, and
the empty boast of high-sounding title,
the disgrace thrown upon them by this
so public act was too insulting to be endured
even by their humility. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>absolutely necessary, that some steps
should be taken to vindicate themselves
from such undeserved aspersions. Accordingly
without loss of time they
addrest letters to the Abbess of Zurich
and to their guardians, Abbot Conrad,
and the good Bishop of Coira. They
disclosed the place of their concealment,
asserted the gross injustice of the Emperor’s
act, and avowed their willingness
to lay every particular respecting themselves
or their conduct before either of
their guardians, or the respected Abbess.</p>

<p class='c017'>Till this period they had neglected to
apply to these firm friends; because
they felt a total indifference to the
station, which they had lost; considered
the pleasures of the great world as
withdrawn from them for ever; and
only wished to pass the remainder of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>their lives in tranquillity and oblivion.
Their letters communicated the greatest
joy to those, to whom they were addrest;
and Abbot Conrad lost not a moment
in hastening to comfort the poor
afflicted ones, and to assure them of his
unabated regard and anxiety for their
welfare.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was no difficult task for the Sisters
to convince this partial friend of their
innocence. He insisted upon the necessity
of their returning to the world,
and Constantia consented to quit her
solitude: but Ida was resolute never
again to resume her proper station, till
her honour and reputation were re-established
in their full purity and with
undiminished lustre.</p>

<p class='c017'>And how is this to be effected? Oh!
Elizabeth, it is you alone, who can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>answer that question. You have seen,
how these unjustly persecuted Girls
have been deprived of every thing, of
their inheritance, of their fair fame, of
the very name, to which their birth
entitled them: you have seen their innocence
and your own error. Your
generosity, your love of justice will tell
you, what you ought to do: to those
noble sentiments, to your own noble self,
I dare trust my cause without a single
terror.—</p>

<p class='c017'>Henry of Montfort’s illness had been
long and dangerous. He was scarcely
recovered, when two successive attacks
of apoplexy convinced his uncle of a
truth, which he had long been unwilling
to confess to himself. He could no
longer deny, that it would be more
suitable at his time of life to turn his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>thoughts towards the grave, than the
bridal bed; but still though he was himself
no longer the hero of them, his
marrying-plans preserved their long-established
dominion over his fancy.
Henry was his undoubted heir; his
attention to Count Egbert during his
illness had made a deep and very favourable
impression upon the old man’s
mind; he suddenly became a favourite,
to secure whose happiness in life was
now Count Egbert’s chief and almost
only object; and in the old man’s
opinion, happiness in life was to be
obtained by no other possible means,
than by marriage. Henry was nearly
of the same opinion with him. Unluckily,
the only point, on which they
differed, was the only material point in
the whole affair. Both agreed, that a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>marriage ought to take place; but each
proposed a different person, and neither
would give up the object of his choice.
Henry insisted upon his engagement
to Ida, and declared, that while she
existed, honour as well as love forbade
his offering his hand to another: while
Count Egbert protested with equal vehemence,
that he never would consent
to the union of his heir with a girl,
whom the last will of her nearest relation
had deprived of her inheritance
and devoted to disgrace. The bride of
his selection presented herself in a far
more flattering light; ’twas Elizabeth,
the young and admired heiress of Torrenburg,
whose hand would confer
wealth and power on her husband, and
whose heart had formerly been warmly
disposed in Henry’s favour. As he
listened to this eulogium upon Elizabeth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>an involuntary sigh escaped from the nephew’s
bosom. Ah! he felt but too
sensibly the whole value of Elizabeth,
and was fully conscious, how dear she
would have been to him, had not Ida
possest prior and more forcible claims
on his affections. Now all thoughts of
Elizabeth were quite unavailing: his
heart by right was another’s, and was
no longer worthy of Elizabeth’s acceptance.
This he declared to his uncle,
and exprest his resolution of keeping
his engagements to Ida in terms so
strong, that the old Count lost his
patience completely. In the heat of
passion, he ordered Henry to quit the
Castle that instant, nor ever presume to
come again into his presence.</p>

<p class='c017'>He was obeyed; but the command
was scarcely given, before it was repented
of. He reflected, that this very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>banishment would leave his nephew at
liberty to contract the union, which it
was so much his wish to prevent. The
old man was little acquainted with Ida’s
character and turn of mind: he knew
not, that delicate as were her notions
on the subject of honour, the warmest
entreaties of her beloved Henry would
by no means be sufficient to persuade
her to become Countess of Montfort.</p>

<p class='c017'>Count Egbert’s guards followed
Henry, overtook him, and brought him
back to his paternal Castle, where he
was ordered into close confinement.
How little did the writer of these lines
ever imagine, that he should live to see
menaces and chains employed, in order
to compel a youth to give his hand to
Elizabeth of March!</p>

<p class='c017'>Henry exclaimed loudly against such
injustice! He demanded, that the opinion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>of his proposed bride should be
taken in this affair. He declared himself
convinced, that he could not possibly
appeal to a more just tribunal, and that
after what had past, a proposal of marriage
would be rejected with no less firmness
by Elizabeth, than by himself. The
old Count denied this last assertion most
positively. He maintained (and not
without some show of plausibility) that
in spite of his past offences Elizabeth
was still weak enough to cherish a secret
attachment to the man, by whom she
had been so unworthily forsaken: nay,
he even went so far as to profess his
firm belief, that the severity, with which
she had treated the Damsels of Werdenberg,
had its origin in this attachment;
and that nothing but female spite and
jealousy against a successful rival, made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>her so obstinately shut her eyes and
ears against the justice of those claims,
which in the opinion of many persons
(thoroughly capable to decide upon such
matters) were held to be most just, and
founded on an unquestionable basis.</p>

<p class='c017'>Such indeed was now the general
opinion. Time, and the exertions of
their guardians had cleared up many
suspicious circumstances respecting the
Sisters; and the popular cry was fast
turning to the side of Count Frederick’s
lineal heirs. Their uncle’s testament
underwent much censure, and created a
kind of prejudice and ill will against Her,
who had benefited by it so largely.
Elizabeth herself was in some measure
the cause of this loss of public estimation,
which in truth every day diminished.
She had accustomed the world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>for so long to see her act with uniform
generosity, and to consider her as a
person totally exempt from the ordinary
imperfections of her sex, that as soon as
her husband’s will was made public,
every one prepared themselves for some
decided act of heroic self-denial in favour
of the disinherited Sisters; and which
perhaps they would not have expected
from any other than Elizabeth, because
they would not have believed any other
capable of such an act. However, it is
certain, that from Her they <i>did</i> expect
it; it is also certain, that their expectations
were disappointed; and unwilling
to allow, that they had themselves
required too much, they were extremely
displeased with Her, whom they accused
of not having done enough. Besides
this, Elizabeth evidently fell into a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>error, in dealing with her inherited
possessions, as if they had been her
own purchased and personal property.
Formed by nature to be no less rash
than generous, she gave away whole
districts, castles, and towns with as little
concern, as if they had been of no more
value than the roses, which encircled
her head or bloomed upon her bosom.</p>

<p class='c017'>This inconsiderate liberality produced
the greatest discontent among those
subjects, whom she bestowed away
with so little ceremony. She is already
informed of the uproar and confusion,
which ensued; but she is by no means
aware of the extreme danger, in
which she was at one time involved.
The discontented vassals denied her
right to make them over to another,
and declared themselves to be lawfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>the vassals of the young Countesses of
Werdenberg: they entered into a secret
correspondence with the neighbouring
Switzers: they dispatched messengers
to the valley, where the Sisters had
taken refuge, and assured them of their
firm resolution to support their rights.
Constantia was already departed; they
found Ida alone in her humble cottage,
and made the purport of their coming
known to her. Tears of joy trickled
down her cheeks as she listened, and
her first words were prayers of gratitude
to Heaven.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“My worthy friends,” said she at
length, “your words have given me
the only comfort, which I now could
look for on this side the grave! The
Ida, whom a whole good and honest
people demands for their sovereign,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>can never be that traitress, that unprincipled
wanton, that ungrateful snake,
which I have been termed so publicly
and so unjustly. Your application has
given me back my honour, has reconciled
me with myself: this is all I could wish
for; now leave me, my friends, and
bear with you my warmest thanks. Be
faithful to your liege-lady; Heaven and
my uncle’s will have destined her for
your protectress, and you will find
her a noble one. I know well her
merits, and admire them; I envy her
not her good fortune; but be assured,
that even did my happiness depend on
my establishing those rights, which you
state me to possess, the Ida whom your
deputation has thus signally honoured,
at least deserves that honour too well,
to seek any benefit however great by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>clandestine, and therefore by unworthy
means.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>The deputies listened to her with
astonishment; they requested her to
reflect coolly upon their proposals, and
left her with a promise to return.</p>

<p class='c017'>And they <i>did</i> return, furnished with
new and much more forcible arguments;—and
yet those arguments were employed
in vain. They had discovered
Ida’s former affection for Henry: they
applied to Count Egbert, and laid their
plans before him. As they appeared to
reconcile all differences between his
nephew and himself, he readily promised
his assistance: and the deputies
now delivered a letter to Ida, in which
Count Egbert assured her of Henry’s
unabated attachment: he magnified the
fortitude, with which his nephew had resisted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>all attempts to shake his fidelity;
and he conjured her to accept the title of
Countess of Montfort, since without the
possession of her hand there was no
happiness in life for Henry.</p>

<p class='c017'>The poor Ida wept, as she read this
letter: every line seemed an arrow in
her very heart. She was conscious,
that in her present humble state she
could never become her lover’s bride,
and that the old Count’s consent was
entirely grounded on the prospect of
her succeeding to Count Frederick’s
inheritance.—Yet she still shuddered at
the thoughts of obtaining the accomplishment
of her fondest wishes by
means, which she felt to be unworthy
of her; she still positively rejected the
proposals of the embassy, and declared
herself convinced, that Henry of Montfort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>was as little disposed as herself to
assist any plan, whose object was to
injure Elizabeth. The deputies still
prest her to comply; they would take
no refusal; and at length to free herself
from their importunity she left the
valley privately, and took refuge within
a Convent, the name of which she concealed
from every one except her sister
and the Abbot of Cloister-Curwald.</p>

<p class='c017'>Elizabeth’s knowledge of these transactions
was confined to their mere outward
appearance. She knew, that she
was calumniated by secret enemies, and
justified by unknown friends; but little
did she suspect, that these favourable
judges of her conduct were those very
persons, against whom she had nourished
in her heart the most inveterate
prejudice. Its true, that she was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>without real friends, willing even to
risk her displeasure, rather than suffer
her to labour under such gross errors:
the Abbot of Curwald often endeavoured
to lay the history of the unfortunate
Sisters before her eyes, but in vain:
No one understood better than Elizabeth
the secret of imposing silence on those,
whom she suspected of an intention to
say that, which it was by any means
disagreeable to her to hear.</p>

<p class='c017'>She suddenly thought fit to take up
her abode in the Convent of Zurich,
and there indulge her grief for the loss
of Count Frederick without restraint.
This was a step, which her differences
with her discontented vassals rendered
both agreeable to herself, and proper in
the eye of the world: into the bargain,
it possest the further advantage (though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>she thought it as well to confine this
motive for her seclusion to her own
bosom) of freeing her from the wearisome
remonstrances of the Abbot, and
from the truths, which he was so obstinately
bent upon placing before her eyes.
It’s true, she was still exposed to receiving
letters from him; but those it was
in her power not to answer; or indeed
not even to read, if the first lines gave
her reason to believe, that the remainder
would afford her but little satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c017'>But Elizabeth was too good, too
noble, to be entirely deserted by truth
and virtue, however sedulously she
strove to shun them. They pursued
her to the Convent, and their imploring
voices often spoke to her in the stillness
of her solitary cell. I know from good
authority, that many a seed of good has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>fallen upon her heart, which she has vainly
endeavoured to choak in brambles: and
should I succeed in my attempt to seduce
her unconsciously into perusing the history
of the Damsels of Werdenberg,
under the title of “The Sisters without
a Name,” (a title, which describes them
but too well, since injustice and error
have robbed them of their proper one)
I shall look upon the victory as already
won.</p>

<p class='c017'>And yet by such a victory, what will
be gained? How is it in Elizabeth’s
power to benefit these persecuted girls?
Constantia, who (unknown to her former
friend) now inhabits the same
Convent with her, demands nothing in
this world except permission to take the
veil: Ida is contented with her humble
habitation near the Lake of Thun;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>and far from requiring from Elizabeth
anything more than mutual forgiveness,
she is willing to compensate for the involuntary
mortification, which she caused
to her on her bridal day, by the sacrifice
of every thing; even of that, which she
holds dearest! Yes, Elizabeth; she
is willing to sacrifice even the hand and
affections of her Henry!</p>

<p class='c017'>The proposal made by the deputies of
Elizabeth’s rebellious vassals was laid
before Henry by his uncle. The plan,
whose object was the ruin of the unsuspecting
Countess of Torrenburg, was so
well laid, and the preparations were in
such forwardness, that it seemed almost
impossible for the design to fail. Henry
gave a feigned compliance to the old
Count’s proposals, and was rewarded
with his liberty. The first use, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>he made of it, was to hasten to Richard
of Ulmenhorst, to whom Elizabeth had
entrusted the government of her domains
during her seclusion in the Convent.
To him did young Montfort
discover the conspiracy against the
Heiress of Torrenburg, and they agreed
upon measures for defeating it. The
noble Richard had loved Elizabeth in
the earliest spring of his life, and had no
reason to despair, till the blooming
Henry appeared and won the prize,
almost before he himself desired it.
Richard now first knew the real character
of his so long-hated rival: and
to know it, and admire it, were but the
same. The conspiracy was defeated;
the new friends separated; and Henry
hastened to the Lake of Thun.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Ida!” he exclaimed, “I am thine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>and for ever! I have broken through
every obstacle, which divided us; I have
severed every chain, which detained me
from your arms. I renounce the name
of Montfort, which has inflicted upon
me nothing but misfortune: never shall
the man, who so unjustly lords it over
my possessions, hear of his persecuted
nephew more. You, Ida, must renounce
the title of Werdenberg, which has been
the cause to you of so much sorrow,
and resume that beloved name, which
you bore, when we first met. This
cottage, this garden, and this little flock
are enough to content all the wishes of
two loving hearts; and Erwin Melthal
and Rosanna Tell will pass together such
days, as even, the happiest might look
upon with envy.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>Ida felt in her bosom a painful conflict
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>between love and duty. She had
renounced wealth and splendour for
herself without a pang; but ought she
to renounce them for Henry? Ought
she to suffer him to quit for her a station,
on which he was calculated to
confer such lustre? Such were her
doubts; yet undoubtedly love would at
length have triumphed, had not a report
reached her, that Elizabeth’s situation
was become more difficult than ever.
Her vassals had given up in despair all
hopes of persuading the Sisters to contest
the Count of Torrenburg’s will.
They found, that Elizabeth was destined
to remain their sovereign: yet they
protested (with such violence as gave
reason to apprehend the most dangerous
consequences from a refusal) that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>on one condition only would they return
peaceably to their obedience. That condition
was, that if Elizabeth was to be
still their liege-lady, Henry of Montfort
should become their liege-lord: and they
swore, that she never should enter the
Castle of Torrenburg except as Henry’s
wife, unless she chose to see her way
strewn with bleeding corses.</p>

<p class='c017'>Letters from Richard of Ulmenhorst
confirmed this report; and the generous
Ida’s resolution was taken without a
moment’s delay.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Go, my beloved!” she exclaimed
and embraced him for the last time.
“You were not born to waste your
days in the obscurity of these shades.
Power and splendour form the proper
sphere for you to move in, and those it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>is not in the poor Ida’s power to bestow!
Go then, Henry; protect Elizabeth;
content her people; make your wife,
make your vassals, make <i>yourself</i> happy;
your praises will reach me even in this
secluded valley.... Then <i>I</i> shall
be happy too!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>Henry obeyed her: to refuse was in
truth impossible! With every hour
and from every quarter fresh entreaties
arrived, all assuring him, that if he
meant to rescue the Countess of Torrenburg
from the fury of her rebellious
subjects, not a moment must be lost.—He
determined to sacrifice every other
consideration, to that of Elizabeth’s
welfare: he is arrived at Zurich: he
has renounced his claims to Ida’s affections;
Ida has renounced her rights to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>her uncle’s inheritance; and to-morrow
will see Henry of Montfort kneeling at
the feet of Elizabeth, and will hear him
offer her his hand for the second time.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><i>Elizabeth, Countess of Torrenburg, to Conrad, Abbot of Cloister-Curwald.</i></h3>

<p class='c019'>Conrad! Conrad! how was it possible
for me to mistake for a moment
the characters of <i>your</i> pen, for those of
any other? Of that pen, which like its
master’s persuasive tongue, knows how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>to blend truth, raillery, and praise together
so artfully, that the heart feels itself
irresistibly subdued, irresistibly compelled
to follow, whither-soever it is
your pleasure to conduct it!</p>

<p class='c017'>I was aware of your power: it was
therefore that I fled from your presence,
that I shunned your conversation, that I
declined your correspondence. I knew
well, that your eloquence could give a
fair appearance even to the worst cause;
and at that time Ida’s cause was believed
by me to be one of the worst,
otherwise I would not have fled from
its discussion.</p>

<p class='c017'>But now how are my sentiments
changed! Helen, sainted Helen! now
then the time is arrived for my imitating
thy glorious example: Ida is a second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Amalberga: Elizabeth shall be a second
Helen!</p>

<p class='c017'>No: Helen’s curse shall not fall upon
<i>my</i> head: I will not hate those, whom
<i>she</i> has blest; I will not rob her beloved
ones of their inheritance. Look down
on me, fair saint! Behold; I sacrifice
to Ida that, which is most precious to
me, the affection of my heart, the happiness
of my life, the hand of Henry:
and can you doubt, whether I will restore
to her that which I prize so little, a few
handfuls of sordid earth?</p>

<p class='c017'>Conrad, my whole soul is in a storm!
I scarcely know, what I say ... what
I write ... what I think ... in
the present moment, I can only feel!—Yet
ere I close my letter, learn thus
much. Constantia is with me; yesterday
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>I clasped her to my heart. Alas!
for the gentle, innocent, suffering girl!
Never did my bosom harbour against
<i>her</i> one spark of ill-will: her intercourse
would have been like balsam to the
wounds of my heart, even while I hated
Ida as the inflictor of those wounds.
It was cruel in you, my good Abbot, to
let me inhabit the same dwelling with
her for so long, and yet keep me in
ignorance, that such a blessing was so
near me.</p>

<p class='c017'>In truth, you have not dealt well with
me throughout; neither yourself, Conrad,
nor your confidante the Abbess of
Zurich. The most secret recesses of
my soul were known to you, while I
believed them to be closed against all
the world; you knew much, of which I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>would have purchased the knowledge
with my whole wealth, and which you
concealed from me far too long.  I
thought, that I acted without being
observed: and you were busied in
watching and numbering every step
which I took. I cannot feel quite satisfied
with your proceedings towards me;
my heart involuntarily breaks out into
reproaches and complaints. Yet neither
complaints nor reproaches can now
avail. The die is cast; I cannot avoid
following the path, which is pointed out
by duty—<i>cannot</i>, did I say?—No; let
me not wrong my feelings: I <i>would</i>
not, if I <i>could</i>!</p>

<p class='c017'>Oh! that I could paint to you in
colours sufficiently vivid the scenes,
which followed my perusal of your manuscript!—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>Abbess is ill.... I fear
ill unto death!—I flew to her sick bed,
and with the enthusiasm of my sensations
forced her back from contemplating
the fields of blessedness, to
which she is already so near, that she
needs but to close her eyes in order to
behold the reflection of their glories!
She smiled at what I said to her, and which
must have appeared to her so trifling, so
unworthy of a thought, when compared
with those images by which her mind
had just been occupied.—Her words
inscribed themselves upon my heart in
characters of flame: you will soon be
informed of their effects.</p>

<p class='c017'>Constantia was summoned—the Abbess
joined our hands; we sank upon
each other’s bosom. No explanation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>was necessary; no one spoke a word;
we understood <i>her</i> ... we understood
ourselves.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Now then,” said the invalid in
a soft faltering voice, which seemed a
middle tone between a mortal’s and a
spirit’s: “now then nothing is wanting
... but the presence of Ida!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>—“Of Ida,” I repeated, “and of
her Henry!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>And Henry came; came the next morning, as
you had assured me that he would,
and for that purpose which you mentioned.
He has vindicated my cause like an
hero, and has fully established my authority
and my rights: he has knelt at my
feet; he has offered me his hand. He has
named love as the reward of his services,
and has obtained the boon: how could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>I refuse the reward of love to the most
pure, the most tender, the most unfortunate
of lovers?</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><i>Constantia, Countess of Werdenberg, to Abbot Conrad.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Elizabeth’s letter must already
have apprized you, my kind protector,
of the favourable change, which has
taken place in the situation of your
wards. Count Henry has been here,
and is again departed. He came by
Ida’s command to offer his hand to
Elizabeth: he is returned at Elizabeth’s
desire to salute her rival as joint-heiress
with myself of the rich domains of
Torrenburg.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“I do no more than my duty,”
said Elizabeth, when Henry endeavoured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>to express his gratitude. “Your heart
belongs to Ida, and never <i>ought</i> to be
another’s, therefore never <i>can</i> be mine.
As to Count Frederick’s inheritance,
demand of this venerable man, whose
claim to it is the most just; that of
Elizabeth, or of the Damsels of Werdenberg.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>As she spoke, the door opened, and a
silver-haired stranger entered the apartment.
It was the Sage of Zurich, the
well-known Albert Reding, to whom
Elizabeth had referred her disputed
claims, previous to your unveiling the
truth of our history, and removing her
prejudices against us. Yes, Conrad,
yes! even had she still continued to
abhor us, so sure as I have life, Elizabeth
would still have acted by us with
justice!</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>The venerable Albert confirmed Elizabeth’s
declaration; he even consented
to accompany the enraptured Montfort
to Ida’s valley, and make known to her
this sudden change in her situation.
They would fain have persuaded me to
join their party: but I could not endure
the thoughts of quitting my generous
friend, at a moment, when she so greatly
needs support after this difficult self-victory,
and under the deep affliction
which she feels at the approaching dissolution
of our worthy Abbess.—Farewell,
dear father, and believe, that
the memory of your kindness shall live
in my heart for ever!</p>

  <h3 class='c018'><i>Abbot Conrad to Sigisbert, Bishop of Coira.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Count Henry of Montfort and his
bride are established in the Castle of
Torrenburg. Their arrival threw the
populace into an ecstasy of joy, and all
inclination to uproar and revolt seems
to be completely annihilated. Neither
is Elizabeth any longer an object of
aversion to her former subjects; you
are already informed of the laudable
manner, in which she past the
month immediately succeeding the death
of the Abbess of Zurich, and which she
entirely dedicated to providing for the
future benefit of those, over whom she
was so soon to renounce all jurisdiction,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>and who (while under her command)
had been so little sensible of the value
of such a mistress.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“The few minutes,” said she,
when she addrest them for the last
time; “the few minutes, during which
I can still consider you as my subjects,
shall be employed in convincing you,
that you mistook my character; and
that your welfare neither is now, nor
ever was, indifferent to the heart of
Elizabeth. I am preparing to resign
my authority into the hands of the
Damsels of Werdenberg; but that
authority shall be the only one worth
having, authority over a <i>free people</i>.”—</p>

<p class='c017'>What she promised, she has performed
most amply. Everything in
these regions breathes freedom and
happiness; she has established the privileges
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>of this people on grounds so firm,
that even were the antient Tyrants of
Carlsheim and Sargans to resume their
abused authority, they would be compelled
to leave their subjects in possession
of their unviolated freedom.</p>

<p class='c017'>Henry and Ida would fain have exprest
to her their gratitude in person;
but she has declined receiving them for
the present, under colour of too great
affliction for the late loss of her friend,
the Abbess. How say you, my Lord
Bishop?—I fear, the heart of our Elizabeth
is by no means healed, since she
cannot prevail on herself to endure the
sight of her rival’s happiness, even
although that happiness is a work of
her own creation.</p>

<p class='c017'>Well! well!—time I hope, will do
much; and (unless I flatter myself with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>believing too ardently what I wish) the
attentions of Richard of Ulmenhorst
will do more. This excellent young
man is full of hope, that he may yet
be able to establish his former claims on
the heart of Elizabeth; Ida and Henry
encourage him in his sanguine expectations;
and no efforts of mine, that can
advance his wishes, shall be wanting,
you may be sure. However, nothing
can be attempted, till St. Helena’s Festival
arrives; on that day Elizabeth has
promised to receive all her friends
(Henry and Ida not excepted) and every
one looks forward with the utmost
impatience to this appointed day.</p>

<p class='c017'>Of course Constantia did not fail to
be present at the wedding of her beloved
sister. Methinks, her passion for the
Cloister is sensibly diminished since her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>re-establishment in her legitimate claims.
With my whole heart shall I say—“Amen!”—to
her resolution to lay
aside the veil: she is so well calculated
to form the blessing of an earthly
bridegroom, that it would be a sin to
bury her within the walls of a Convent.
She already numbers many powerful
noblemen in the list of her admirers;
but no one hangs upon her smiles with
more perfect adoration, than Count
Oswald, Elizabeth’s brother. He has
confided his passion to me, and I am
best able to judge the nature of his
sentiments. No contracted views of
interest (as many unjustly suppose, and
as perhaps Constantia herself suspects)
induce him to kneel at the feet of the
rich Heiress of Sargans: no one can
imagine such a motive, who is acquainted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>with the real character of the
proud but noble Oswald, the lustre of
which is bright and glorious as the
light of the sun; though like that luminary
it is now and then obscured by a
few dark spots, moveable and insignificant.
No; he seeks the hand of
Constantia from no other cause than
the consciousness of her perfections;
except that he repents of his former
injustice towards the Sisters, and is
anxious to express his present respect
in the most marked and striking
manner.</p>

<p class='c017'>I know not, what hopes he is authorized
to nourish. The quiet retired
Constantia gives encouragement to none
of her admirers, and observes an obstinate
silence respecting her intentions
even to me: however, Count Oswald
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>possesses a powerful interest in her
opinion from his being the brother of
Elizabeth.—I expect that the festival of
St. Helena will decide much.</p>

  <h3 class='c018'><i>Conclusion—written by Abbot Conrad.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>That the readers of the fore-going
manuscripts may not be left with their
curiosity entirely ungratified, I will
endeavour to fill up the chasm, which
otherwise would appear in the Memoirs
of Elizabeth. Let me obtain their
pardon, if I relate as briefly as possible
the circumstances of a scene, which
produced upon my heart an impression
very painful at the time, and never to
be obliterated.</p>

<p class='c017'>St. Helena’s festival arrived. All
those, whom Elizabeth had invited,
failed not to attend at the appointed
place and hour; among them were the
Heiresses of Torrenburg, Count Henry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>of Montfort, Count Oswald of March
(Elizabeth’s brother) Richard of Ulmenhorst,
the Bishop of Coira, and myself.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is the pious and laudable custom
of our days (a custom, which I hope
will be preserved even to the latest
posterity) that all our most distinguished
festivities should commence by
offering an homage of adoration to
the Supreme: it was therefore natural,
that immediately on our arrival we
should be conducted to the church
belonging to the Convent of Zurich.
Yet we could not help feeling some
surprize, that Elizabeth as our hostess
did not welcome us at the church-door,
and place herself at the head of our
procession, while it moved through the
cloisters towards the chapel; that being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>the established custom on such occasions.
However, we had scarcely time
to make any reflections, before we found
ourselves within the chapel.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was most gorgeously adorned, as if
set out for some great solemnity. The
walls were decorated with wreaths of
flowers; the reliques were exposed, the
pictures were uncovered: the whole
wealth of the Convent was displayed,
and blazed on every side; innumerable
tapers in chandeliers of gold, intermingled
with silver lamps, dispelled the
gloom of the long aisles; and clouds
of incense rolled along the fretted roof,
which echoed back the melodious
sounds of lutes and voices, as they
swelled in full chorus from the adjoining
choir. At that moment our
knowledge of church-customs naturally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>made the Bishop and myself conceive
a suspicion of the purpose, for which
we had been conducted thither: perhaps
too, the same thought suggested
itself to Constantia, for on a sudden her
tears began to flow. The situation of
Richard of Ulmenhorst was most distressing:
he ceased not to enquire, why
Elizabeth did not appear; and it was
with difficulty, that Montfort, Ida, and
Count Oswald (who preserved their
presence of mind better than the rest)
could persuade him to observe that
silence, which was necessary in so holy
a place.</p>

<p class='c017'>Unhappy Richard! for many weeks
past had his friends conspired to buoy
him up with hopes, which this single
moment was destined to destroy for
ever: for now the curtain, which concealed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>from us the chapel’s sanctuary,
was withdrawn, and all our worst
fears were confirmed. Elizabeth, adorned
with all the pomp and splendour of
wealth, and still more with all the
charms, which nature had bestowed
upon her superior to her whole sex,
knelt before the altar, and offered up
at the footstool of the Almighty’s
throne the greatest sacrifice, which a
mortal can ever make; the sacrifice of
youth, love, beauty, liberty, and life!</p>

<p class='c017'>What impression this unexpected,
this unwished for scene made upon the
assembly at large, it is neither in <i>my</i>
power to describe, nor (I believe) in
the power of any one of those, who
were personally interested about Elizabeth.
Each individual felt so much
upon his own account, that he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>rendered incapable of attending to the
sensations produced upon others. It
was not till the awful ceremony of pronouncing
the great and total renunciation
was on the point of taking place,
that I turned my eyes upon the countenance
of the unhappy Richard: it was
pale as that of a corse; and yet with
every moment it seemed to grow still
paler, till his eyes closed, and he sank
into my arms without sentiment.</p>

<p class='c017'>—“My soul,” said Elizabeth in a
firm voice, “I bequeath to him, who
gave it! my body I bequeath to the
grave; my wealth to the church; the
domains of Torrenburg to its legitimate
possessors; the recollection of Henry
of Montfort to his beloved Ida; Richard
of Ulmenhorst.... Richard, my friend
of youth, and the truest of all lovers....
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>Richard, whom I ought never to
have quitted for the sake of any
Montfort.... Ah! to what consoling
Angel shall I consign the noble Richard,
that she may heal the wounds inflicted
by my caprice on his honest suffering
heart?—Constantia! friend of my
bosom, be thou that Angel! thou art
far more worthy of his love than the
inconstant Elizabeth, who in resigning
<i>him</i>, resigns every prospect of earthly
happiness; who in sacrificing <i>him</i>, offers
up to Heaven the greatest sacrifice, of
which her nature is capable.—Be he
thine, dear injured Constantia; accept
from me his hand, his heart! my injustice
to Ida I have repaired by the
resignation of Henry; but I still
owed thee a mighty sacrifice, to efface
the memory of many a bitter hour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>occasioned by my obstinacy, my persecution,
my self-will.—Now then I have
done with the world for ever!—Beloved-ones!
I bless you!—Pray for
me, and farewell!”—</p>

<p class='c017'>The Bishop (though greatly affected
by this whole unexpected scene) thought
it right to wait till the conclusion of
the ceremony: But anxiety for Richard,
whose indisposition had occasioned the
bye-standers to remove him into the
open air, furnished me with an excuse
for leaving the chapel, which I seized
with eagerness. To say the truth, I
was far from satisfied with Elizabeth’s
determination. I shall no doubt be
severely censured by my more devout
successors; yet I needs must confess,
that in spite of my own vows (which I
pronounced with the most heart-felt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>joy, and never have felt the slightest
wish to retract) yet still I say, in spite of
my own vows, I never have seen without
a pang society deprived of a valuable
member, and those talents buried within
the solitude of the Cloister, which might
have made its owner a blessing to the
world at large.</p>

<p class='c017'>When the first shock was past,
Richard recovered his resolution, and
endeavoured to conceal the agony of
his feelings under the veil of seriousness
and silence. A splendid entertainment
was spread before us, at which none of
the holy Sisters appeared; consequently,
we were at liberty to communicate our
sentiments on what had just past without
restraint. ’Twas the most melancholy
feast, at which I ever assisted; a
feast, which I shall never forget, as long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>as I possess existence; it seemed to me
Elizabeth’s funeral-feast! we soon rose
from the table, on which the viands
remained untouched, and we prepared
for our departure; for we thought
it vain to expect admission to the newly-profest
Nun, and indeed in our present
temper of mind that admission was
scarcely to be wished—the Bishop, however,
delivered it as his opinion, that
propriety required us at least to give
Elizabeth the option of seeing us. Accordingly,
a message informed her of
our approaching departure; her answer
was, that she must decline all visits,
except those of Constantia and of
Richard of Ulmenhorst.</p>

<p class='c017'>They obeyed her orders. Elizabeth
received them with joy and tenderness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>She doubted not the success of her
proposal, and addrest Constantia as the
heiress of Richard’s heart: but she was
speedily undeceived. Richard declared,
in terms so express as left no doubt of
his decision, that since Elizabeth was
lost to the world, no refuge was left
for him but the Cloister; while on
the other hand, Constantia confest, that
her heart was no longer in her own
power. After a long and unavailing
discussion, Elizabeth dismist them,
whether satisfied or displeased by the
firmness of her two dearest friends,
it may be difficult to say: but unless
I am totally ignorant of the female
mind, she could not help being flattered
by Richard’s refusal to admit any rival
to her in his heart, but God; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>probably she was secretly not much
incensed against Constantia for having
bestowed her affections else-where.</p>

<p class='c017'>Count Oswald, who had been by no
means pleased by his sister’s endeavours
to unite Richard and Constantia, now
felt his hopes revive: he flattered himself,
that <i>he</i> was the unknown object
of Constantia’s choice; but in this
belief he was mistaken. There was a
young knight, who had offered her his
heart and hand at a time, when she
had nothing but a heart and hand to offer
in return. Conradin, an ill-portioned
brother of the Landgrave of Thuringia,
would have loved her, had she been no
other than Mary Tell; Conradin had
been faithful to Constantia of Werdenberg
under all the scorn and obloquy,
under which she at one time laboured;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>and Conradin was now the man, for
whom the wealthy Heiress of Sargans
rejected every other. <i>He</i> deserved the
inestimable treasure of a wife like
Constantia; and <i>she</i> was well worthy
to be the mistress of a heart, whose
tenderness and generosity could only be
excelled by her own.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was long, before Elizabeth acquired
sufficient firmness to receive
the personal thanks of Ida and Henry
for that felicity, of which she was herself
the authoress; but on the day
when she was consecrated as Domina
of Zurich, this long-delayed interview
took place. The impression, which it
made upon her mind, will be best explained
by the following letter.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c006' />
</div>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><i>Elizabeth to Constantia.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>At length then this dreaded interview is
over: I have seen Ida and her happy
husband.—Wrong me not, Constantia,
by suspecting, that resentment or pique
has made me delay this meeting for
so long; oh! no! it was the consciousness
of my own weak heart!—Even
Helen of Homburg could not at
once resolve to witness the happiness
of Eginhart and Amalberga; and alas!
I am no faultless Saint like Helen!—the
Cloister is the palace of enthusiasm,
is the native land of visions; its inhabitants
are only happy in proportion,
as those visions are sweet and soothing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>I had formed for myself a little circle
of ideal companions, whom at my pleasure
I could summon to dispel my
solitude. My venerable friend, by the
side of whose death-bed I formed the
resolution of dedicating my life to the
service of Heaven, was among the
dearest of those apparitions. The hand
of mortality had torn her from me;
Enthusiasm restored her to my arms.
I saw her, as if she had been still
alive.... I spoke to her, and laid open
the most secret folds of my heart....
I almost fancied, that at times I heard
her reply in words of comfort....
Alas! the fatal sight of Ida and her
Henry has dispelled all these visions,
which were to me the source of so much
happiness! it seemed like a flash of
lightning, which penetrates through our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>closed eye-lids, and wakes us suddenly
from some delightful dream.—Now
nothing flits before me in my solitude,
but those scenes of my melancholy life,
in which Ida and Montfort bore so
great a share.—Leave me, oh! leave
me, ye cruel thoughts, which force me
back to a world of sorrow; and thou,
mild-spirit of my sainted friend, return,
and by thy presence aid me to prepare
for that state of bliss, which <i>you</i> already
enjoy, and to which I feel that <i>I</i> am
hastening.</p>

<p class='c017'>The will of Heaven be done; but the
moment of dissolution will be sweet
and welcome!</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
